Exhibit (Page 13). Please summarize what this image or diagram shows and list its components.

The image shows a diagram of a gas compressor. The main components of the compressor include a turbine, a spring, a piston, and a spring. The turbine is responsible for generating the force needed to compress the gas. The spring is used to store energy and provide a smooth and consistent flow of gas. The piston is responsible for transferring the energy from the turbine to the spring, and the spring then transfers the energy to the piston. The diagram also shows the pressure and flow of gas within the compressor.
