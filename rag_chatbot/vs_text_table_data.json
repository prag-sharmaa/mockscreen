It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describe established mitigation options that Partners should\nreference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the equipment and\nprocesses described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas operations, including onshore,\noffshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions are quantified and mitigated may vary\nacross locations and operational environments. As such, operational conditions, as well as logistical, safety\nand cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP assumes that methane\nemission mitigation actions that require shut-downs of non-redundant equipment/processes (e.g., that would\nresult in a stoppage of operations) would be carried out during regularly scheduled maintenance activities,\nunless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy of an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nA major component of remote, automated control of natural gas and petroleum industry facilities is the\noperation of control valves, which are often powered and actuated by natural gas through pneumatic\ncontrollers. In addition, there are natural gas-powered pumps used for injecting chemicals and other\npurposes. Several types of these equipment release or “bleed” natural gas to the atmosphere by design. In\naddition to emissions by design, pneumatic controller loops and pneumatic pumps can also emit gas because\nthey have a defect or a maintenance issue. In fact, recent field measurement studies2 have pointed out that\na large fraction of total emissions from pneumatic devices in the Production segment are a result of devices\nthat are not operating as designed (due to a defect or maintenance issue).\nBecause millions of pneumatic controllers are used in the oil and gas industry worldwide, they collectively\ncomprise a major source of methane emissions. Depending on a device’s function, design, and operation,\nthe emission rate can vary (e.g., a controller’s bleed, valve actuation gas vent, and a pneumatic-driven\npump’s actuation gas).\nControllers and pumps may be powered by compressed air or utility-supplied electricity. At remote\nproduction, gathering, and gas transmission facilities, compressed air or electricity may not be available\nand economical. In such cases, operators may use the available inherent energy of pressurized natural gas\nto power these devices.\n1 As described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\n2 Methane Emissions from Process Equipment at Natural Gas Production Sites in the United States: Pneumatic\nControllers, Allen et al. 2014. dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5040156 | Environ.

    "text": "Number 1: Natural Gas Driven Pneumatic Controllers and Pumps\nNatural gas driven chemical injection pumps are common equipment in the natural gas industry where there\nis no reliable electricity available. These pumps inject methanol and other chemicals into wells and\npipelines, and are vital to the production process. For example, methanol prevents crystalline methane\nhydrate formation that can lead to blockages in pipelines. Pneumatic pumps use gas pressure to alternately\npush on one side and then on the other side of a diaphragm connected to a piston pump. The gas is vented\nat each pump movement.\nMost pneumatic controllers in oil and gas production are designed to vent gas as part of normal operation.\nSufficient, pressurized natural gas available in the operating facility, called supply gas or power gas -\ntypically pressure regulated to 20-50 pounds per square inch gage (psig), (1.4-3.6 kilograms per square\ncentimeter (kg/cm2)) - is sent to a pneumatic controller loop. Pneumatic control loops consist primarily of\na gas pressure actuated valve and a system to regulate the actuation gas.3 Pneumatic gas pressure pushes\nagainst a diaphragm in the valve actuator, which pushes a connecting rod to move the valve plug open or\nclosed. Venting this gas to the atmosphere at the controller allows a spring to push the diaphragm back,\nclosing or opening the valve. The valve regulates various process parameters such as temperature, pressure,\nflow rate, and liquid level. Examples include liquid level in separators, suction and discharge pressures for\ncompressors, and temperature in heaters or gas dehydrator regenerators.\nBLEED: Actuation gas regulation is done in several ways, including manual open and close (shut-off\nvalves), and automatically by measurement of the process parameter. Automatic controllers have devices\nthat measure the process parameter (i.e. liquid level, pressure, temperature, flow-rate) and translate that\nmeasurement into a modulated gas pressure signal to the valve actuator. This signal from the process\nmeasurement to the valve controller is called a “bleed,” and in some types of pneumatic controllers, the\nbleed stream continuously flows to the atmosphere even when the valve position is not changing. In\ncontinuously modulated control valves the bleed stream is diverted into the valve actuator and flows to the\natmosphere when the valve position is restored or stationary. A second type of valve controller, called\nintermittent bleed, has the process signal flowing only when the process parameter needs to be adjusted by\nopening or closing the valve. In this type of process control, sometimes called “snap-action” or “dump\nvalve,” there is no vent or bleed of gas to the atmosphere when the valve is stationary. A third type, called\n“gas pressure regulators,” discharges the valve actuation gas back into the process stream, and thereby have\nno atmospheric gas vent. Manual shut-off pneumatic valves and gas pressure regulators are not subject to\nthis core source.\nThere are many remote, unmanned facilities in oil and gas production (e.g., wellheads), gathering and\nboosting stations (e.g., gas/liquid separators, tanks, dehydrators, compressors), and transmission\ncompressor stations that use methane-containing natural gas to regulate process control valves. Many\ncomplex processes at these facilities require pneumatic controllers, each of which can vent an average of\none-half cubic foot of gas per minute for continuous bleed and one-quarter cubic foot per minute for\nintermittent bleed controllers.4 As a result, millions of pneumatic controllers exist throughout the industry\nworldwide and together emit significant volumes of methane.\nPneumatic devices within the context of this core source are designed in three basic configurations:\n3 U.S. EPA.

Continuous bleed\ndevices can be either high- or low-bleed devices, and vent gas to the atmosphere at the average\nbleed rate when the valve is in a stationary position.\no Low-bleed pneumatic devices6 mean automated control devices powered by pressurized\nnatural gas that continuously modulate the process control valve position. The process\nmeasurement signal gas flows to the valve controller continuously and vents (bleeds) to\nthe atmosphere at an average rate equal to or less than 6 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh)\n(0.17 standard cubic meter per hour (scmh)). These are used for continuously modulating\na process condition. The bleed stream may or may not vent to the atmosphere continuously,\ndepending on whether the valve actuator is accumulating gas or discharging gas.\no High-bleed pneumatic devices7 are automated control devices powered by pressurized\nnatural gas that continuously modulate a process condition. The process measurement\nsignal gas flows to the valve controller continuously and vents (bleeds) to the atmosphere\nat an average rate in excess of 6 scfh (0.17 scmh). The bleed stream may or may not vent\nto the atmosphere continuously, depending on whether the valve actuator is accumulating\ngas or discharging gas.\n Intermittent bleed pneumatic devices8 mean automated process control devices powered by\npressurized natural gas and used for automatically maintaining a process condition such as liquid\nlevel, pressure, delta-pressure, and temperature. These are snap-acting or throttling devices that\ndischarge all or a portion of the full volume of the actuator intermittently when control action is\nnecessary (i.e. when the control valve position needs to change), but do not bleed natural gas to the\natmosphere when the valve is in a stationary position and functioning properly.\n Non-methane emitting pneumatic controllers come in two types: 1) those that discharge the valve\nactuation gas back into the process (gas pressure regulators), and 2) those that use sources of power\nother than pressurized natural gas, such as compressed air or nitrogen. Both of these types of\ndevices do not release methane to the atmosphere, but they may have energy impacts as electrical\npower is required to drive the instrument air compressor system. Gas processing plants generally\nuse instrument air for pneumatic controllers and pumps.\nNatural gas driven pneumatic pump means a pump that uses pressurized natural gas to move a piston or\ndiaphragm, which pumps liquids on the opposite side of the piston or diaphragm.9\nNatural gas-driven pneumatic controllers and pumps can be configured in a variety of ways. Partners\nshould identify the configuration for each controller and pump. Some options include those listed in the\nTable 1.1. 10\n5 Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases: Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, 40 CFR Part 98.6, U.S. EPA.\n6 Ibid.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid.\n10 The Partners may identify additional mitigation options and the following list is not meant to be a comprehensive\nlist of all mitigation technologies.\nPage 3 of 20",

In principle, direct\nmeasurement can be considered as the most accurate method for quantifying methane emissions.12 Where\na sound basis is in place, measurement can contribute to greater certainty on emissions levels and economic\ncosts and benefits (i.e., value of gas saved). As such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever possible\nto establish this basis.\nThe OGMP recommends partner companies use one of the following methodologies to assure the consistent\nquantification of emissions and the comparable evaluation of mitigation options. These quantification\nmethodologies include activity data count, direct measurement, manufacturer estimate, engineering\nestimates, or emission factor approach. Individual Partners may choose an alternative quantification\nmethodology if judged to be more accurate by the Partner; in this case, the Partner should document and\nexplain the alternative methodology in the Annual Report.\n Activity Data Count: A key and often undervalued part of emission quantification is the activity\nfactor, or count, of gas-driven pneumatic devices and pumps. As part of the OGMP, Partners must\ninventory all gas-driven controllers that emit natural gas to the atmosphere within their participating\noperations. A sample pneumatic site survey form is included in Table 1.4.\n Direct Measurement: Because continuous, high-bleed pneumatic controllers do not operate with a\nsteady gas atmospheric flow rate, measurements is best made while the valve is in a stationary position:\nthis represents the average bleed rate. Alternatively they should be measured over a long enough period\nto capture several valve movement cycles to determine the average flow rate of bleed (the process\nmeasurement pneumatic signal) and valve actuation gas. These measurements will provide the total gas\nflow rate, which is then converted to methane emissions using the methane content of the gas. For\ncontinuous high-bleed devices, Partners should extrapolate the methane flow rate to account for an\nentire year of normal operations. Continuous, low-bleed pneumatic controllers can be measured the\nsame way as continuous, high-bleed devices to confirm that they meet the low-bleed standard of less\nthan or equal to 6 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) (0.17 standard cubic meter per hour (scmh)).\nIntermittent bleed devices are controlled, and thereby do not need to be quantified. Other quantification\nmethodologies are provided for cases where direct measurement is not feasible. Partners are encouraged\n12 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the instrument\nmanufacturer instructions. Measurements should also be conducted in different operating conditions, to the extent that\nthose can affect emissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument\nuse. Partners seeking to generate Emission Factors for their operations should use direct measurement based on a\nstatistically sound number of measurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable\nhydrocarbons.\nPage 5 of 20",

This is important so that the measurement points are\naccurately identified and that measurements completely capture a device’s methane emissions. A\nchemical injection pump typically vents methane locally and has no other equipment associated with\nits emissions.\nMethods from Allen et al. (201314) and Allen et al.

Finally, manufacturer data is only accurate for new instruments in the exact application\n(the specific supply gas pressure, for example).\n Engineering Estimates: For intermittent vent controllers in on/off service (i.e. snap-acting controls or\ndump-valves) every time the device shifts from “on” to “off”, the same volume of gas is vented. This\nvolume per actuation (Vol ) can be calculated by Equation 117:\nscf\n𝜋 𝑃 +𝑃\ncontrol atm\n𝑉𝑜𝑙 = [ 𝐼𝐷2×L +∆Vol ]× ⌈ ⌉\nscf pipe bonnet\n4 𝑃\nstd\nAnnual Emissions = (Estimated number of actuations per device per year) X (Vol )\nscf\nVariable Description FPS Units SI Units\nID Inside diameter of piping scf scm\npipe\nL Length of all piping in system ft m\npipe\nThe change in the physical volume of a\nΔVol pneumatic valve actuator when changed from at scf scm\nbonnet\nrest to fully actuated\nP Local atmospheric pressure psia kPaa\natm\nP Pressure of the supply gas system psig kPag\ncontrol\nPressure designated by proper authority to\nP represent the standard pressure to be used for psia kPaa\nstd\naggregating volumes\nThis approach requires a count of actuations for each device per year in order to calculate annual\nemissions.

    "text": "Number 1: Natural Gas Driven Pneumatic Controllers and Pumps\n Emission Factors: If they do not select the direct measurement or the manufacturers’ data approach is\nnot selected, an emission factor approach may be used. Partners are encouraged to use emission\nfactors that best represent conditions and practices at their facilities. Default methane emission factors\nare provided in Table 1.2, Table 1.3, and Table 1.4 at the end of this section.\nThe default emission factors represented in Table 1.2 and 1.3 are based on data derived from the 1996\nGRI/EPA report18 and generally represent estimates of average emissions and populations of devices\nduring the survey period in the early 1990s. These factors may be inaccurate representations of any\nindividual device, particularly for intermittent devices or even current production operations (e.g.,\nhydraulically fractured oil and gas wells). Partners should determine which emission factors best\nrepresent conditions and practices at their facilities and internal corporate protocols.\nMitigation Option A – Retrofit pneumatic high-bleed gas controllers with low-/intermittent-bleed\ncontrollers to reduce gas emitted.\nPartners can achieve significant methane emission reductions and save money by replacing or retrofitting\nhigh-bleed pneumatic controllers if the process can handle a reduction in end-device (combination of the\nactuator and process valve controlling the process) responsiveness and slower operation of the controller.\nLow-bleed gas-driven controllers can replace high-bleed gas-driven controllers in many, but not all,\napplications.19 Partners should consult pneumatic controller vendors or other instrumentation specialists for\ndetails such as costs, applicability, and specifications of various controllers. Partners should specify\npneumatic controllers with bleed rates at or less than 6 scfh (0.17 scmh). Not all manufacturers report their\ncontrollers’ bleed rates similarly; therefore, Partners should ensure a controller is indeed low-bleed at their\nservice’s pneumatic gas supply pressure before purchasing.\nBefore purchasing low-bleed equipment, Partners also should first identify all the candidates for\nreplacement or retrofit. This process can occur during a specific facility-wide pneumatics survey or during\nnormal maintenance. Partners should use the sample survey template or develop a comparable survey and\ninclude the make/model, function, location, condition, and bleed rate (also recording either continuous or\nintermittent bleed).\nOperational Considerations\nApplicability can depend on the function of an individual controller (i.e., whether the controller monitors\nlevel, pressure, temperature, or flow rate). As stated in the previous section, some high-bleed pneumatic\ncontrollers might not be suitable for low-bleed replacement because a process condition might require a\nfast or precise control response so that it does not drift too far from the desired set point. A slower acting\ncontroller could damage equipment, become a safety issue, or both. An example is a compressor where\npneumatic controllers monitor the suction and discharge pressure and actuate a recycle by-pass when one\nor the other is out of the specified target range. Other scenarios for fast and precise control include transient\n(non-steady) situations where a gas flow rate might fluctuate widely or unpredictably. This situation\nrequires a responsive high-bleed controller to ensure that the gas flow can be mitigated in all situations.\n18 Methane Emissions From the Natural Gas Industry. June1996.

    "text": "Number 1: Natural Gas Driven Pneumatic Controllers and Pumps\nTemperature and level controllers are typically present in control situations that are not prone to wide\nfluctuation or the equipment can readily and safely accommodate the fluctuation. Therefore, such processes\ncan accommodate control from a low-bleed device, which is slower acting.\nSafety concerns could be an issue, but only in specific situations because emergency isolation of pressure\nrelief valves are not bleeding controllers. Thus, the connection between the bleed rate of a pneumatic device\nand safety is not a direct one. Pneumatic devices are designed for process control during normal operations\nand to keep the process in a normal operating state. If an emergency shutdown (ESD) or pressure relief\nvalve (PRV) actuation occurs, the equipment in place for such an event is spring loaded. During a safety\nissue or emergency, the pneumatic gas supply could be lost. For this reason, control valves are deliberately\nselected to either open or close on loss of pneumatic gas supply.\nThe implementation of this technology will occur during shutdown of the equipment or system related to\nthe pneumatic device(s) and requires the installation of:\n Low-bleed/intermittent-bleed pneumatic controller or retrofit kits\n Any additional piping, fittings, etc. (if needed)\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nPartners can expect to achieve a significant reduction in methane emissions from high-bleed pneumatic\ndevices after implementing this technology. Once converted to low-bleed, a pneumatic device should emit\nno more than 0.17 scmh or 6 scfh. Recent U.S. regulations do not allow installation of high-bleed pneumatic\ncontrollers in new or modified oil and gas production facilities (i.e., continuous bleed rate greater than 6\nscfh (0.17 scmh).20\nMethane Emissions Reductions = Baseline “Unmitigated” Emission Rate (scfh or scmh) – “Mitigated”\nEmission Rate (scfh or scmh)\nBaseline “unmitigated” emission rate for high-bleed controllers are calculated using one of the following\nmethods:\n Direct measurement averaged on a scfh basis per device or scm basis per device.\n Manufacturer’s estimate.\n If using default values, the unmitigated emission rates from high-bleed controllers equals 37.3 scfh\nor 1.1 scmh.\nMitigated emission rate for low-bleed controllers:\n Direct measurement averaged on a standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) per device or standard cubic\nmeter (scm) per device.\n Manufacturer’s estimate\n20 U.S. EPA.

The capital costs for a low-bleed controller can range from approximately $400\nto $3,500, depending on the controller’s function and design.21 Annual O&M costs are typically negligible,\nand the avoided maintenance costs for an older controller are typically included as a benefit in the economic\nanalysis.\nPartners should determine the volume of gas that will be saved when replacing a high-bleed controller with\na low-bleed one. Direct measurement of bleed emissions from both the high- and low-bleed controllers is\nthe most accurate method. If direct measurement is not possible, operators should use the bleed rates\nspecified by manufacturers on product data sheets. The annual gas savings are equal to the difference in the\nannual bleed rates between the replaced high-bleed controller and the new low-bleed device (assuming\n8,760 hours of operation) multiplied by the gas price.\nOnce Partners have determined which pneumatic controllers can be cost-effectively replaced or retrofitted,\nthey should develop a strategy for implementing this project. Depending on their schedules and procedures,\nreplacement and retrofits can be prioritized, or replacing all eligible high-bleed devices (those that meet the\ncriteria in a company’s analysis) at one time might be more economical. A full replacement can help\nminimize labor/installation costs and shutdown time.\nMitigation Option B – Ensure intermittent bleed controller only vents/emits during the de-actuation\nportion of a control cycle with no emission when the valve is in a stationery position\nIntermittent bleed controllers typically have lower emissions than continuous controllers: 323 scfd (9.15\nscmd) versus 654 scfd (18.5 scmd).22 However, Allen et al. 2014 found that intermittent controllers with\nmalfunctions23 can have high emissions due to venting between actuations. Partners should insure that\nintermittent bleed controllers are functioning properly while designating these pneumatic devices are, and\nremain controlled.\nMitigation Option C – Install instrument air system for pneumatic gas supply/use.\nPartners can achieve significant methane emission reductions when converting a natural gas pneumatic\nsystem from natural gas to compressed instrument air. By substituting air, companies are effectively\neliminating methane emissions entirely from control valves and pumps, and creating additional safety\nbenefits (because of the elimination of a flammable substance). Partners should first fully evaluate their\nfacilities to identify viable candidates for this mitigation option, however, because it is not as universal as\n21 EPA.

Instrument air systems require an accessible and reliable source of electricity and\ncompression to be economical and beneficial to partner companies. Typically, processing plants and\nfacilities have the most consistently available use of electricity; however, Partners might have production,\ntransmission, and distribution facilities with a reliable electricity system as well.\nAn instrument air system consists of a compressor(s), dehydrator, volume tank, and power source. The\nprincipal costs for converting a gas-powered pneumatic system to instrument air are the initial capital costs\n(for compressors, dehydrator, volume tank, etc.) and the O&M costs to power the compressor motor. If a\nfacility has a centralized power gas system, existing gas-powered pneumatic components (e.g., piping,\ncontrollers, and actuators) are likely compatible with instrument air, so Partners will save on capital costs\nfor this equipment.\nOperational Considerations\nThe two main requirements for an instrument air system are 1) reliable electric power and 2) a large enough\nnumber of pneumatic devices to justify the cost. Once a project site has been identified, it is important to\ndetermine the necessary capacity of the instrument air system. The capacity needed is a direct function of\nthe amount of compressed air needed to 1) meet utility air requirements, including pumps, and 2) operate\nthe pneumatic instrumentation.\nUtility air does not have to be dried. The frequency and volumes of such utility air uses are additive. Partners\nwill need to evaluate these other compressed air services on a site-specific basis, allowing for the possibility\nof expansion at the site. A general rule of thumb is to assume that the maximum rate of compressed air\nneeded periodically for utility purposes will be double the steady rate used for instrument air24 (e.g.,\npneumatic air uses: one-third for instrument air, two-thirds for utility air).\nThe compressed air needs for the pneumatic system are equivalent to the volume of gas being used to run\nthe existing instrumentation, adjusted for air losses during the drying process. The current volume of gas\nusage can be determined by a direct meter reading (if a meter has been installed). In non-metered systems,\na conservative rule of thumb for sizing air systems is one cubic foot per minute (cfm) of instrument air for\neach control loop (consisting of a pneumatic controller and a control valve).25\nThe instrument air volume adjustment for air losses from a membrane filters air dryer is about 17 percent\nof the air input.26 As a result, the estimated volume of instrument air usage is 83 percent of the total\ncompressed air supply (i.e., divide estimated air usage by 83 percent). Desiccant dryers do not consume air\nand therefore require no adjustment.\nThe implementation of this technology will occur during shutdown of the equipment or system related to\nthe pneumatic device(s) and requires the installation of:\n Instrument air compressor\n Power source for compressor\n Dehydrator or air dryer\n Weatherproof enclosure and piping\n Volume tank\n24 U.S. EPA.

The actual installation costs are a\nfunction of the size, location, and other location-specific factors. A typical conversion of a natural gas\npneumatic control system to compressed instrument air costs approximately $45,000 to $75,000.27\nTo estimate the cost for an instrument air system, all expenses associated with the compressor, dryer,\nvolume tank, and power supply need to be calculated. Most vendors will typically provide equipment cost\nestimates and installation requirements (e.g., compressor size, motor horsepower, electrical power\nrequirements, and storage capacity).\nFor the instrument air compressor, it is common to install two compressors at a facility (one operating and\none on stand-by) to ensure reliability and allow for maintenance and overhauls without service\ninterruptions. The capacity of each compressor must be sufficient to handle the total expected compressed\nair volume for the project (i.e., both instrument and utility air). For screw-type compressors, Partners should\nexpect to overhaul the unit every five to six years.28 This normally involves exchanging the compressor\ncore for a rebuilt compressor at a cost of approximately $4,000, with an additional $700 in labor expenses\nand a $650 salvage value.29\nFor volume tanks, the rule of thumb in determining the size of the tank is 1-gallon capacity for each cubic\nfoot of compressed air. Volume tanks have essentially no O&M costs. A typical equipment cost range is\n$650 to $4,000, depending on the tank capacity.30\nFor air dryers, the most common dryer used in small to medium applications is a permeable membrane\ndryer. Larger air systems can use multiple membrane dryers or alumina bed desiccant dryers (more cost-\neffective). Membrane dryers filter out oil mist and particulate solids and have no moving parts. As a result,\nannual operating costs are kept low. The appropriate sized dryer would need to accommodate the expected\nvolume of gas needed for the instrument air system. Typical air dryer equipment costs are $2,000 to $13,100\nand annual service costs are $700 to $4,300.31\nIt is also necessary to estimate the energy costs associated with operating the instrument air system. The\nhighest operating cost is electricity for the air compressor (unless there is another on-site energy source).\nElectricity costs average around $13,100 annually.32 This assumes that electricity is $0.75 per kilowatt-\n27 Ibid.\n28 Ibid.\n29 Ibid.\n30 Ibid.\n31 Ibid.\n32 Ibid.\nPage 12 of 20",

Based on a 95 percent reduction, OGMP estimates the reduction in emissions in the\nproduction segment to be 0.36 tons per year (tpy) methane and 0.10 tpy volatile organic compounds (VOC)\nper piston pump and 3.29 tpy of methane and 0.91 tpy of VOC per diaphragm pump.\nMitigation Option E – Replace pneumatic pumps with electric pumps, including solar electric pumps\nfor smaller applications such as chemical and methanol injection.\nChemical injection pumps typically operate on pressurized natural gas because they are located at remote\nfield sites that do not have reliable electrical power. Partners also have achieved cost-efficient methane\nemission reductions by replacing pneumatic chemical injection pumps with alternative pumps including\nsolar-charged DC electric devices and standard AC electric devices. In particular, the use of electric\nchemical injection pumps can increase operational efficiency, decreases maintenance costs, and reduce\nemissions of methane, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and VOCs.\nOperational Considerations\nLow-volume chemical injection pumps at remote sites are candidates for electric pumps if the site has an\nelectricity source or if sunlight is available for solar-charged DC pumps. Other operating considerations are\nthe installation of solar panels and a storage battery for each solar device. Besides reviewing the operating\nmanual, minimal additional training is involved to operate solar electric devices.\nThis mitigation project is applicable to all industry sectors where pneumatic pumps are available for\nconversion. In gas production, typical applications include methanol injection in wells and pipelines and\ncorrosion inhibitor injection for wells and other applicable equipment. Chemical injection pumps in\nproduction are usually sized to inject 6 to 8 gallons (23 to 30 liters) of methanol a day.33\nSolar-powered chemical injection pumps can accommodate various ranges of injection pressures and\nthroughputs. Small-volume solar pumps can handle about 5 gallons per day (19 liters per day) at 1,000 psig\ndischarge.34 Large-volume solar pumps typically can inject approximately 38 to 100 gallons per day (144\nto 380 liters per day) at 1,200 to 3,000 psig discharge.35 For maintenance considerations, solar panels and\nstorage batteries help lower downtime and service costs because they typically require very minimal\n33 U.S. EPA.

    "text": "2: Fugitive Component and Equipment Leaks\nSG.17.1.2\nTECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT NUMBER 2:\nFUGITIVE COMPONENT AND EQUIPMENT LEAKS\nIntroduction\nThis document provides technical guidance to Partners of the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership\n(OGMP). It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction, gathering, and processing operations. This guidance document introduces suggested\nmethodologies for identifying and repairing methane emissions from a unique source and describes\nestablished mitigation options that Partners should reference when determining if the source is\n“mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the equipment and emissions described in this document are\nfound in all oil and gas operations, including onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in\nwhich the emissions are detected and mitigated may vary across locations and operational environments.\nAs such, operational conditions, as well as logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be evaluated on\na case-by-case basis. The OGMP assumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-\ndowns of non-redundant equipment/processes (e.g., that would result in a stoppage of operations) would\nbe carried out during regularly scheduled maintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective\naction to be worthy of an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nFugitive emissions arise from unintentional leaks from equipment used in oil and gas operations. Potential\ncomponents or sources of leaks from this equipment include flanges, screw and compression fittings, stem\npacking in valves, pump seals, compressor components2, through-valve leaks in pressure relief devices\nthat vent to the atmosphere, tank thief hatches, meters, and open-ended lines. For the purposes of this\ncore source, emissions from equipment designed to vent as part of normal operations, such as gas-driven\npneumatic controllers, are not considered leaks.\nMethane leaks are typically caused by poor construction, corrosion or wear of mechanical joints, seals,\nand rotating surfaces over time. Fugitive emissions can also occur from devices that are not operating\nproperly such as intermittent pneumatic devices that are malfunctioning and continuously bleeding gas,\nor stuck dump valves on separators3. Common sources of leaks from process equipment/components are\npresented below in Table 2.1.\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\n2 Leaks from compressor seals fall under the compressor-related source described in TGD 3 Centrifugal Compressors with Wet\n(Oil) Seals and TGD 4 Reciprocating Compressors.\n3 See TGD 1, Natural Gas Driven Pneumatic Controllers and Pumps\nPage 1 of 19",

    "text": "2: Fugitive Component and Equipment Leaks\nQuantification Methodology\nWhile the primary objective of this mitigation practice is finding and fixing leaks, it is recommended that\none or more of the following methodologies be used to quantify annual fugitive emissions in unmitigated\nfacilities and estimate reductions that result from repairing unintentional leaks from oil and gas\noperations. Mitigated facilities will not be required to quantify leak repairs. In principle, leak screening\nfollowed by direct measurement of identified leaks can be considered the most accurate method for\nquantifying methane emissions for determination of cost-effectiveness of repair. Where a Directed\nInspection & Maintenance (DI&M) program is in place, measurement can contribute to greater certainty\non emissions levels and economic costs and benefits (i.e., value of gas saved in areas which have a gas\nmarket). As such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever necessary to establish the cost-\neffectiveness of a leak repair where there is a market for gas. When direct measurement is not feasible,\nfugitive emissions can be estimated using “leaker emission factors”9 for detected leaking components.\nIndividual Partners may choose an alternative quantification methodology if judged to be more accurate\nby the Partner; in this case, the Partner should document and explain the alternative methodology in the\nAnnual Report.\nPartners can identify fugitive emissions through one or more leak screening techniques (listed below).\nOnce leaks are identified, several emission measurement or estimation techniques exist to quantify\nmethane emission rates. Partners should choose the most appropriate leak screening and measurement\ntechniques according to the component or equipment being analyzed. Some techniques are more\napplicable to certain pieces of equipment/process components. For example, using soap solution is not\nfeasible if the component being screened is too hot or too cold, has too large an opening (e.g., open-\nended vent pipe), or is physically inaccessible, in which case an optical gas imaging camera or laser leak\ndetector may be more appropriate. Measurements provide a flow rate for whole gas or methane\ndepending on the device used. If applicable, Partners should then convert the flow rate to methane\nemissions using the methane content of the gas and then extrapolate it over the estimated duration of\nthe leak. An annual volume of methane emissions is calculated by multiplying the estimated or measured\nmethane emissions flow rate by half the operating hours of a piece of equipment between the last leak\nsurvey that found the component not leaking and the time when a leak is found and repaired. Operators\ncan use a default factor of 12 months for estimating leak quantity.\n Leak Screening Techniques: Assets/facilities should be screened for leaks and vented emissions\nusing one or more of the techniques listed below and described in Appendix A to the Technical\nGuidance Documents. Screening should include all components and equipment at the facility.\nEquipment surveyed should include, but not be limited to, facility piping, valves, connectors,\nflanges, compressor components, open-ended lines, as well as equipment such as pneumatic gas\n9 Default Whole Gas Leaker Emission Factors for Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production Facilities and Onshore\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting Facilities. http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?SID=97687ab553b499b28a3bdd9bd26942f9&mc=true&node=ap40.23.98 _1238.5&rgn=div9\nPage 4 of 19",

Direct\ninspection involves a screening of equipment components to identify leaking components.\nLeaking components are identified with emissions detection equipment listed in Appendix A or\nequivalent. The inspection identifies individually those components that are found to be leaking\nmethane-containing gas. Each leaking component that can be repaired on the spot should be\nrepaired taking into account feasibility considerations such as volume of leak, safety\nimplications, cost-effectiveness, and complexity of repair (e.g., ability to repair immediately with\nsimple maintenance or need for shut down to repair). In order to claim mitigation for this\nsource type, all components found to be leaking are repaired within 12 months of identification,\nunless repair within this time span is determined to not be cost-effective. If a partner chooses to\nreport emission reductions from fugitive equipment and process leaks in the OGMP Annual\nReport, the date of repair, type of component and quantity (measured or estimated) of the\nmethane emission reduction are documented. Fugitive emission reduction credits are taken in\nthe year that the actual repair is done.\n Annual Fugitive Component and Equipment Leak Survey: For each year following the\nBaseline Fugitive Component and Equipment Leak Survey a modified, direct inspection is\nconducted. Leaking components are identified with emissions detection equipment listed in\nAppendix A or equivalent. This survey typically focuses on components and equipment in\nmethane-containing gas service that were found to be leak-prone in the Baseline Fugitive\nComponent and Equipment Leak Survey or subsequent leak surveys. This survey identifies\nindividually leaking components within the boundary of the participating facility. Leak repairs are\nmade on the spot when feasible, and within 12 months of the leak identification when economic.\nIf the partner chooses to report fugitive emission reductions in their OGMP Annual Report, leak\nsurvey findings are recorded including the dates, component types and the quantity of methane\nemission reductions, measured or estimated.\nOperational Considerations\nAs leaks are located during the baseline or subsequent surveys, Partners should estimate or measure leak\nrates for emissions reductions following repairs and when repair economics are uncertain. Direct\nmeasurement is done when safe and feasible, using any one of several measurement techniques\ndescribed in this document or Appendix A. Detection and quantification (ideally by direct measurement\nequipment as outlined in the previous section and detailed in Appendix A - Emission detection and\n11 In some countries, for regulatory compliance, operators are required to implement a LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair)\nProgram. DI&M and LDAR are significantly different while the objective is the same: reduction of fugitive emissions. The DI&M\npractice is based on cost-effective methane emission reduction, whereas LDAR defines leaks that must be repaired, even when\nnot economical. LDAR regulations are very prescriptive and inflexible, with considerable records-keeping and retention, and\npotential penalties for non-compliance. DI&M is strictly voluntary best practice of methane fugitive emissions reduction.\nPage 6 of 19",

For reference, experience shows that a\nmajority of fugitive emissions from upstream facilities derive from valves, connectors, flanges and\ncompressor seals.12 Other emissions occur primarily from open-ended lines, crankcase vents, pressure\nrelief devices that vent to the atmosphere, pump seals, and scrubber/vessel dump valves passing gas with\nliquid to separators or tanks. Experience indicates that the majority of emissions from leaking equipment\nand process components typically come from a relatively small percentage of leaking components.\nAs leaks are identified and quantified, Partners should record the baseline leak data so that future surveys\ncan focus on the most significant leaking components. If the leak cannot be immediately repaired,\nPartners should tag leaks for tracking purposes and document the results of the DI&M survey. The\ninformation that Partners might choose to collect includes the following:\n An identifier for each leaking component.\n The component type (e.g., blowdown open-ended line).\n The measured or estimated leak rate.\n The survey date.\n The estimated annual gas loss.\n The estimated repair cost.\nThis information will help Partners direct subsequent emissions surveys, prioritize future repairs, and track\nthe methane savings and cost-effectiveness of the DI&M program.\nThe final step in a DI&M plan is to develop a survey schedule using the results of the baseline survey to\nguide future inspection and maintenance protocol. Partners should develop a survey schedule that\nachieves maximum methane savings yet also suits the unique characteristics and operations of their\nfacilities. For example, Partners can base DI&M surveys on the anticipated life of repairs during the\nprevious survey or on the frequency of follow-up surveys on company maintenance cycles or the\navailability of resources. Given the flexibility of a DI&M program, if subsequent surveys show numerous\nlarge or recurring leaks, Partners can increase the frequency of DI&M follow-up surveys. These follow-up\nsurveys can focus on previously repaired components or on the classes of operations/assets characterized\nas most likely to leak.\nAn effective DI&M plan should include the following elements:13\n A comprehensive plan to screen for leaking components.\n12 EPA.

Some operations might be found to have very few leaks, in which case internal technology\ntransfer between assets/facilities can facilitate better leak performance in other operations.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nThe potential methane emission reduction from implementing DI&M programs will vary depending on\nthe size, age, equipment, and operating characteristics of the facility. Studies referenced below indicate\nthat a DI&M program can profitably repair 78 to 92 percent of equipment leaks, with a 6 to 12 month\npayback.\nFor more information, see:\n Natural Gas STAR technical Document “Conduct Directed Inspection and Maintenance at\nRemote Sites” https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/\nconductdimatremotefacilities.pdf.\n Natural Gas STAR technical Document “Test and Repair Safety Valves”\nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/ testandrepairpressuresafety\nvalves.pdf .\n Natural Gas STAR technical Document “Directed Inspection and Maintenance at Compressor\nStations” https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/ll_dimcompstat.pdf.\n Natural Gas STAR technical Document “Directed Inspection and Maintenance at Gas Processing\nPlants and Booster Stations” https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/\nll_dimgasproc.pdf.\nEconomic Considerations\nThe cost of performing DI&M screening/measurement depends on several factors, including the team\nperforming the survey (internal or hired contractor), size/type of facility being screened, and equipment\nused. For an internal team, an estimated capital cost for leak screening and measurement equipment is\nPage 8 of 19",

Labor\ncosts for DI&M screening/quantification will vary according to the number of components to be screened\nwithin a given facility. As an example, at a labor rate of $30.46/hour,17 assuming two days of a two-man\nteam for a small gas processing plant, four days for a large gas processing plant, using an IR camera and a\nhigh-volume sampler,18 the estimated cost range for facility screening and measurement labor is $1,200\n(small processing plant) to $2,400 (large processing plant). These costs may apply to an offshore platform,\nwhere there is an equivalent concentration of many fugitive components. For wellsites, the leak survey\nand repair would have to be incorporated into normal operational rounds to make this practice cost-\neffective. Note that the referenced EPA Natural Gas STAR Program documents have a method to update\ncosts to current costs.\nAs previously mentioned, the initial investment costs for leak detection and measurement equipment\nmight be greater than outsourcing the work. Considering that the purchased equipment and training can\nbe applied to future surveys, however, this initial investment can pay for itself through gas savings from\nfound and fixed leaks. In addition, developing a plan for sharing the equipment and training across several\nfacilities will help Partners further amortize the initial investment cost. The economics for an initial\ninvestment in detection and measurement equipment depend on how many facilities are going to be\ninspected each year.\nShould a Partner decide to rent leak detection and measurement equipment, an example payback\nscenario could assume a daily rental cost of $1,000 for an optical leak imaging camera and $400 for a high-\nvolume sampler. In this case, with labor costs of $1,200 to $2,400 (per the example above) and a pipeline\ngas value of $3/MMBtu, natural gas savings of 900 to 1,700 thousand standard cubic feet (Mscf) (25,000\nto 50,000 standard cubic meters (scm)) would pay back the small and large plant gas processing plant\nsurvey costs, assuming costs to fix the leak are treated as normal maintenance costs. These gas savings\n14 EPA. “Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production, Transmission, and\nDistribution.” Background Technical Support Document for Proposed Standards.\n15 For more information concerning detection and measurement equipment, please reference Appendix A: Leak Detection and\nQuantification Equipment.\n16 EPA.

Using a general costing rule of thumb of $1/component,19 the cost range for a baseline survey\nwould be $14,000 (small facility) to $55,000 (large facility). Experience has shown that follow-up surveys\nin an ongoing DI&M program cost 25 to 40 percent less than the initial survey because subsequent surveys\nfocus on the components found most likely to leak. For some equipment components, leak screening and\nmeasurement can be performed most efficiently during a regularly scheduled DI&M survey program. For\nother components, Partners can incorporate simple and rapid leak screening into ongoing operation and\nmaintenance procedures.\nEmission Factors\nTable 2.3 provides methane emissions “leaker” factors20 for equipment found to be leaking in the natural\ngas production, gathering and boosting, and processing sectors. Note that leaker emission factors help\nestimate emissions from sources that have been identified to be leaking and therefore are applied only\nto those components that have been found to be emitting gas.\nUpstream oil and gas facilities that have already implemented a formal DI&M program can also use\nemission factors provided in Table 2.4:21\nTable 2.3: Onshore Operations Methane Emission Factors\nLeaker Emission Factor Leaker Emission Factor\nService Component\n(scf/hour/component) (scm/hour/component)\nValve 4.9 0.14\nFlange 4.1 0.12\nAll Components – Connector(other) 1.3 0.037\nGas Service Open-Ended Line 2.8 0.079\n19 Cost estimate for processing plant using infrared camera and high-volume sampler as primary tools.

The document\nintroduces suggested source-specific methodologies for quantifying methane emissions and describes\nestablished mitigation options that Partners should reference when determining if the source is\n“mitigated”.1 The OGMP recognizes that the equipment and processes described in these documents are\nfound in a variety of oil and gas operations, including onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the\nway in which the emissions are quantified and mitigated may vary across locations and operational\nenvironments. As such, operational conditions, as well as logistical, safety, and cost considerations, must\nbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP assumes that methane emission mitigation actions that\nrequire shut-downs of non-redundant equipment/processes (e.g., that would stop operations) would be\ncarried out during regularly scheduled maintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective\naction to be worthy of an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nCentrifugal compressors have seals on the rotating shafts that prevent the high-pressure natural gas from\nescaping the compressor casing. These seals can be high-pressure oil (\"wet”) seals or mechanical gas\n(“dry”) seals, which act as barriers against escaping gas. The wet seal centrifugal compressors circulate oil\nunder high pressure between rings around the compressor shaft, forming a barrier against the\ncompressed gas to prevent its escape to the atmosphere. Figure 3.12 presents a typical wet seal setup,\nwhere the seal oil enters through the inlet (top) and provides a barrier by forming two thin films under\nhigher pressure between the center rotating ring and the two stationary rings.\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\n2 EPA.

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document\nNumber 3: Centrifugal Compressors with “Wet” (Oil) Seals\nFigure 3.1: Typical Wet Seal Setup3\nSome rings are attached to the rotating shaft, while rings on each side are stationary in the seal housing,\npressed against a thin film of oil flowing between the rings to both lubricate and act as a leak barrier. Very\nlittle gas escapes through the oil barrier to the atmosphere, but a significant amount of gas can be\nentrained by the oil on the “inboard” (compressor) side of the seal at the oil interface with high-pressure\ngas, thus contaminating the seal oil. The large majority of gas entrained with seal oil as it exits the seal is\nnot in solution with the oil; it can be easily disengaged in a small pressure vessel or atmospheric tank.\nFor wet seal compressors, contaminated seal oil must be purged of the entrained gas to maintain viscosity\nand lubricity before it is recirculated. This is done by routing the seal oil to a tank to disengage gas, and\nthen gravity drain the “dead” seal oil to a seal oil sump from which the seal oil is pumped back to the\nseals. Both of these seal oil tanks are typically vented to the atmosphere in uncontrolled wet seal\ncompressors. Wet oil seal compressor degassing systems may be configured in a variety of ways. For\npurposes including mitigation evaluation and annual reporting, Partners should identify the configuration\nof each compressor within their OGMP operations/assets. Table 3.1 describes some common\nconfigurations of wet oil seal compressor degassing systems.\nFor the purposes of the OGMP, Partners will quantify and evaluate for mitigation any of the configurations\npresented in Table 3.1 that are identified as “unmitigated” for methane emissions, as described in the\nsections below. Even for “mitigated” configurations, Partners should evaluate the system regularly to\nensure that it is functioning properly and minimizing methane emission levels as can be observed by\ninspecting flare ignition and/or atmospheric vents from the seal oil sump or the seal face of a dry seal\nusing an IR leak imaging camera. Possible equipment failures resulting from improperly functioning\nsystems include an intermediate degassing system malfunction, dry seal malfunction or an extinguished\nflare.\n3 Global Methane Initiative All-Partnership Meeting, Oil and Gas Subcommittee – Technical and Policy Sessions,\nKrakow, Poland, October 14, 2011: “Routing Centrifugal Compressor Seal Oil De-gassing Emissions to Fuel Gas as\nan Alternative to Installing Dry Seals,” presented by BP\nPage 2 of 13",

In principle, direct measurement is the most accurate method for quantifying methane\nemissions.5 With direct measurement, Partners can be more certain of emissions levels and economic\ncosts and benefits (i.e., value of gas saved). As such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever\npossible. Individual Partners may choose an alternative quantification methodology if judged to be similar\nor more accurate by the Partner; in this case, the Partner should document and explain the alternative\nmethodology in the Annual Report.\n Direct Measurement6:\n4 “Flare” in this document refers to vertical combustion devices using an open or enclosed flame.\n5 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the instrument manufacturer\ninstructions. Measurements should also be conducted in different operating conditions, to the extent that those can affect\nemissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument use. Partners seeking to\ngenerate Emission Factors for their operations should use direct measurement based on a statistically sound number of\nmeasurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\n6 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Subpart W – Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, Section 98.233 Calculating GHG\nEmissions, 40CFR98.233(o). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?SID=5f683140b2cb15cf1e9732111939df98&mc=true&node=se40.21.98_1233&rgn=div8.\nPage 3 of 13",

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document\nNumber 3: Centrifugal Compressors with “Wet” (Oil) Seals\nDirect measurements provide a flow rate for whole gas that is then converted to methane emissions\nusing the methane content of the gas being compressed, and then extrapolated over the entire year.\nAn annual volume of methane emissions is calculated by multiplying the measured methane emission\nflow rate by the operating hours of the compressor. Partners should express the vapor volumes at\nrelevant temperature and pressure conditions to avoid potential miscalculations and reporting\ninconsistencies.\nPrior to measurement, it is important to determine where the gas stream resulting from seal oil\ndegassing is routed to help ensure that the measurement point(s) are accurately identified. Typically,\nemissions from centrifugal compressor degassing systems are routed through a single vent stack.\nHowever, each compressor and facility setup is unique, and a compressor can potentially have\nmultiple degassing vent stacks. Similarly, a centrifugal compressor might have a vent for its lubricating\noil, which could potentially be confused with the seal oil vent. This can be determined using seal oil\nand lubricating oil design drawings and tracing the pipelines in the facility from the seals and degassing\ntank vent to the atmosphere. Observing the two vents with an IR leak imaging camera will readily\nshow substantially more vent emissions from seal oil than lube oil vents. Compressors housed in\nbuildings normally have vents that are routed outside the compressor building through the roof or\nside walls, so it may not always be clear which vent corresponds with respective wet seals.\nConsequently, to avoid confusion, Partners should confirm the wet seal compressor vents by tracing\npiping from the source to the end point and observing the vents with an IR leak imaging camera.\nSurveying the vents and the compressor with an infrared (IR) leak imaging camera (designed to visually\nidentify hydrocarbon emissions) will identify emission points that should be measured. Examining\ncompressors where the gas is routed to a source other than the vent is also beneficial to identify any\nunexpected emissions. Possible routes for degassed methane from wet seals include compressor\nsuction, VRUs, fuel gas (high or low pressure), flare, and atmosphere. However, leak detection should\nbe performed on any other piping or equipment connected to the wet seal compressor.\nRecommended measurement tools include the following:\n Vane anemometer.\n Hotwire anemometer.\n Turbine meter.\n Hi-flow sampler.\nFor more details regarding each measurement tool, including applicability and measurement\nmethods, please refer to Appendix A.\n Emission Factor Approach:\nIf direct measurement is not possible, Partners should instead use an emission factor method. Using\nthis method, Partners apply an emission factor that represents emissions of methane volume per year\nper compressor, adjusted for the actual operating factor of the compressors (i.e., the percentage of\ntime in a year that a compressor is in operating mode). Partners are encouraged to use emission\nfactors that best represent conditions and practices at their facilities. Table 3.2 presents default\nmethane emission factors for centrifugal compressors with wet oil seals in gas processing plants.\nPage 4 of 13",

Partners should assume their own operating\nfactors (i.e., the percentage of time in a year that a compressor is in operating mode) to estimate an annual\nemission factor.\nNote: Emission factors are based upon data from compressors operated outside of the United States and for\nnatural gas processing stage.\nscm: Standard cubic meters of CH .\n4\nscf: Standard cubic feet of CH .\n4\nMitigation Option A - The gas released from the seal oil by an intermediate pressure seal oil/gas\nseparation system is routed to a pressurized inlet such as compressor suction, fuel gas, or flare.\nDegassing the seal oil at intermediate - rather than atmospheric - pressure reduces emissions and allows\npressurized gas to be captured and directed to beneficial use. In this option, seal oil contaminated with\ngas is degassed in a small disengagement vessel for each seal at compressor or fuel pressure. Seal oil exits\na compressor at pressures ranging from less than 30 psig (2 kg/cm2) suction pressure to over 1,000 psig\n(70 kg/cm2) discharge pressure. Operating the disengagement vessel at these pressures (or an\nintermediate pressure above fuel gas pressures, ranging from about 50 to 250 psig (3.5 to 17.5 kg/cm2))\nallows nearly all of the gas entrained in the seal oil to be recovered. The seal oil then flows to the final\nexisting degassing drum where a minimal volume of remaining dissolved methane is degassed and vented\nto the atmosphere. The regenerated seal oil is then recirculated to the compressor.\nThe gas collected from the intermediate pressure disengagement vessel will have a pressure of 50 to 250\npsig (3.5 to 17.5 kg/cm2), which is maintained using 1) a critical flow restriction orifice in conjunction with\na liquid level control valve or 2) pressure and level control valves. This gas can then be directed to\nbeneficial use (for sale and/or use as fuel gas, compressor suction, etc.), and/or be routed to the flare.\nOperational Considerations\nSites must have several operating conditions in place to implement the seal oil recovery option and make\nuse of the gas separated from the seal oil. Onsite equipment such as a fuel gas system or a compressor\nwith the appropriate capacity and suction pressure to receive separated gas is needed to accept and use\nthis new gas stream. Even though the recovered gas is separated from the seal oil, the stream(s) will\nentrain small amounts of seal oil, possibly requiring a gas demister/filter or knock-out vessel to remove\nthis entrained oil to meet an acceptable fuel gas specification. This technology can be largely installed\nwith the compressor(s) online, with the final seal oil piping connections made during a compressor\nshutdown. Equipment includes the installation of:\n7 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2014. Annex 3.

The economics for recovering wet seal degassing\nlosses may be compelling.\nAssuming two seals per centrifugal compressor and two stages of demisting (for routing to a high-quality\ngas line), equipment and installation costs for this technology are estimated to be approximately $33,000\nper wet seal compressor.11 This capital investment per compressor includes the cost of a seal oil/gas\ndisengagement vessel for each compressor seal, two gas demister vessels, new piping, the appropriate\npressure and flow controls, and the labor to design and install the equipment. Operating and maintenance\n(O&M) costs are expected to be minimal.\nSince multiple compressors at a compressor station can be piped to a single gas demister and filtering\nsystem, the economics become more compelling for multiple compressors at a single facility. In a facility\nwith four centrifugal compressors, the total installation and equipment cost is approximately $90,000.\nThis includes the cost of eight seal oil/gas disengagement vessels (two per compressor), two gas demister\nvessels (to ensure all remaining seal oil mist is removed), relevant piping, pressure and level control\ninstrumentation, and labor to design and install the equipment.

The total cost of each seal oil gas\ndisengagement vessel is $9,500; assuming two seals per compressor, the total cost for disengagement\nvessels per compressor is $19,000.\nA seal oil gas demister/knock-out vessel can be designed to receive recovered gas from multiple\ncentrifugal compressors with wet seals. Therefore, the design characteristics of this vessel will vary\ndepending on the number of centrifugal compressors connected to the vessel for a given facility. Table\n3.3 assumes, for a single centrifugal compressor, that the seal oil gas demister is vertical and has a 1-foot\n(30 cm) diameter and 4-foot (122 cm) height with a design pressure of 720 psig (50 kg/cm2). The resulting\ncost for a seal oil single-stage demister/filter system is $9,000 and is applicable to both a single centrifugal\ncompressor and a compressor station with four centrifugal compressors, with minor cost differences due\nto extra piping, instrumentation, structural support, etc.\nIf the recovered gas is used as high-pressure turbine fuel, the recovery system may include a second high-\nefficiency seal oil gas demister/knock-out vessel to ensure any trace amounts of seal oil do not foul the\nturbine fuel injectors. This economic analysis assumes the seal oil gas demister for turbine fuel quality gas\nwill be vertical, made of carbon steel, and have a 1-foot (30 cm) diameter and 3-foot (91 cm) height with\na design pressure of 300 psig (21 kg/cm2). The resulting cost for the second high-efficiency seal oil gas\ndemister is $5,000 for both a single centrifugal compressor and a compressor station with four centrifugal\ncompressors, with minor cost differences due to extra piping, instrumentation, structural support, etc.\nThe cost savings from implementing this technology comes from the value of the gas recovered from the\nseal oil. This gas can be sent either to the fuel gas or sales gas lines. If sent to fuel gas, the recovered gas\nwill offset the facility’s use of site fuel gas. If sent to sales, the recovered gas can be sent back through a\ncompressor first and/or sent directly to the sales line. Based on the emission factors presented in Table\n3.2, the average methane emissions from “unmitigated” centrifugal compressor wet seal degassing is 1.35\nscm/minute (47.7 scf/minute) per compressor. Assuming 8,000 hours of operation per year, the total\nannual methane emissions is 648 thousand scm (Mscm) (22.9 million scf, MMscf) per compressor. This\nanalysis assumes 95 percent of the potential degassing methane emissions are captured and 5 percent is\n12 EPA. Wet Seal Degassing Recovery System for Centrifugal Compressors.

Therefore, 615.6 Mscm (21.7 MMscf) of methane is recovered per centrifugal compressor and\ndisplaces the same volume in fuel gas and/or sales gas. Assuming a gas price of $3 per Mscf and that the\nrecovered gas is close to pipeline quality, revenue from degassing recovery is estimated to be $65,400 per\nyear per centrifugal compressor. A station with four centrifugal compressors connected to a wet seal\ndegassing recovery system could potentially earn revenues of $261,600 per year.\nMitigation Option B – The gas is separated from the seal oil at atmospheric pressure and is routed to a\nVRU for beneficial use or for flaring.\nPartners can reduce their centrifugal compressor wet seal methane emissions by routing seal oil\natmospheric degassing vents to a nearby VRU, for posterior beneficial use or flaring. VRUs compress\natmospheric pressure gas so that it can either be directed to productive use or be routed to flaring, which\nnormally provides a better environmental solution than direct venting of seal gas.\nOperational Considerations\nTo implement this project successfully, Partners need to ensure primarily that the VRU (existing or new)\nhas enough capacity to handle the additional recovered gas from the centrifugal compressor(s), which can\nbe significant. Because VRUs are typically associated with hydrocarbon liquid storage tank emissions,\nwhich fluctuate as tanks fill and empty, a good rule of thumb is to have the VRU’s capacity equal to double\nthe average daily volume of gas recovered.13 For example, to handle 30 Mscf (0.85 Mscm) per day of gas,\na VRU should have a capacity of at least 60 Mscf (1.7 Mscm) per day.\nThis project can typically be implemented with the compressor(s) online, with the final seal oil degassing\nvent piping connections made during compressor shutdown. Assuming a VRU is already present and\nconnected to a fixed-roof atmospheric pressure hydrocarbon liquid storage tank, equipment includes\npiping installed to route the recovered gas to the tank vapor space or VRU suction manifold. 14\nIf a Partner decides to install a new VRU to capture vented emissions, the CCAC OGMP recommends that\nthe Partner considers all potential emissions sources that can be routed to the VRU and set operational\nparameters accordingly. The CCAC OGMP Technical Guidance Document Number 6 (Hydrocarbon Liquid\nStorage Tanks) provides more details about installing a new VRU. Partners should also consider the overall\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission load associated with the additional electricity requirements to run the\nVRU against the base case (i.e., emissions from wet oil seal being directly vented to atmosphere).\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nIt is estimated that Partners can reduce emissions by 95 percent if degassing emissions are recovered at\natmospheric pressure and routed to a nearby VRU.15 Therefore, the estimated methane emissions for a\n“mitigated” centrifugal compressor with degassing recovery will be 5 percent of the unmitigated volume\nof emissions.\n13 EPA.

In cases where the pressure difference among gas lines is large,\npressure regulators may be required.\n15 EPA. Lessons Learned: Installing Vapor Recovery Units on Storage Tanks.

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document\nNumber 3: Centrifugal Compressors with “Wet” (Oil) Seals\nEconomic Considerations\nThis mitigation option’s economics may be compelling, especially if the seal oil degassing vent lines are\nrouted to an existing VRU which has sufficient capacity to handle an increase in throughput. Partners\nshould note that increasing the VRU’s throughput increases its annual electricity costs. However, normally\nthere are no significant capital costs to route gas to an existing VRU because the cost of additional piping\nis minimal.\nFor a VRU with 100 Mscf (2.8 Mscm) per day of capacity, the value of the gas recovered annually would\nbe approximately $52,000.16 Compared to the incremental electricity costs (for how much energy is\nrequired to pump gas to a 100-psig (7 kg/cm2) sales line) and provided there’s sufficient capacity in the\nexisting VRU and that there is beneficial use for the gas (for sale and/or use as fuel gas), the value of the\ngas recovered offsets the additional costs and the project payback is immediate. The economics may shift\nif the recovered gas has no beneficial use and is recovered to be sent to flare. Nonetheless, under these\ncircumstances, there is still a significant environmental benefit, which should not be ignored.\nThe Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage Tanks technical guidance document contains more details about the\neconomics of installing a new VRU.\nMitigation Option C - Convert centrifugal compressor wet seals to dry seals.\nInstalling mechanical dry seals on existing wet seal compressors is another alternative to reducing\nmethane emissions. The mechanical dry seal system does not use any circulating seal oil, and thereby is\nless expensive to purchase, operate, and maintain for new compressors.\nDry seals operate mechanically under the opposing force created by hydrodynamic grooves and static\npressure. Hydrodynamic grooves are etched into the surface of the rotating ring(s) affixed to the\ncompressor shaft. Often dry seals come with two or three pairs of rings (tandem) in the seal housing.\nWhen the compressor is not rotating, the stationary ring(s) in the seal housing are pressed against the\nrotating ring(s) by springs. When the compressor shaft rotates at high speed, compressed gas has only\none pathway to leak down the shaft, and that is between the rotating and stationary rings. This gas is\npumped between the rings by grooves in the rotating ring. The opposing force of high-pressure gas\npumped between the rings and springs pushing the rings together creates a very thin gap between the\nrings through which little gas can leak. While the compressor is operating, the rings are not in contact with\neach other, and therefore, do not wear or need lubrication. O-rings seal the stationary rings in the seal\ncase.\nOperational Considerations\nDry seals are applicable for centrifugal compressors operating up to 3,000 psig (210 kg/cm2) pressure and\n400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Centigrade).17 In addition, dry seals typically include a purge gas\nsystem, especially when compressing highly corrosive or toxic gas such as hydrogen sulfide.\n16 Ibid.

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document\nNumber 3: Centrifugal Compressors with “Wet” (Oil) Seals\nDry seals are mechanically simpler than seal oil lubricating systems because there is no need for oil\ncirculation and treatment equipment. Given that dry seals have fewer ancillary components, they\ngenerally consume less power and have higher overall reliability and less downtime.\nImplementing this technology requires a lengthy and often expensive compressor shutdown to open the\ncompressor case, lift the rotor, remove the existing wet seal rings, and install the dry seal rings on the\ncompressor shaft at both ends. The seal oil system, including piping, instrumentation, flash tanks, and\npumps, can be removed from the compressor site as well. Dry seal conversions might not be possible on\nsome compressors because of housing design or operational requirements, in which case the entire wet\nseal compressor will have to be replaced by a dry seal compressor. About 90 percent of all new\ncompressors come with dry seals. Therefore, when purchasing a new compressor, partners should ensure\nthat it includes a dry seal.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nPartners will determine the amount of methane emissions reduction achieved through conversion to dry\nseals as the difference between measured emissions from the wet seal configuration and the dry seal\nconfiguration.\nPartners should measure the emissions before installing the dry seals and again a month after installation.\nAlternatively, Partners can use the default emission factors for dry seal centrifugal compressors, which\nare presented in Table 3.4, as a proxy. If dry seals use natural gas as the seal barrier fluid, then the amount\nof barrier fluid needs to be added to the seal leakage figures.\nTable 3.4: Default Emission Factor for Centrifugal Compressors with Dry Seals18\nMethane Emission FactorA\nSource (scm/minute/ (scm/hour/ (scf/minute/ (scf/hour/\ncompressor) compressor) compressor) compressor)\nCentrifugal\ncompressor with dry 0.17 10.2 6.0 360\nseal (“Mitigated”)\nA Partners should assume their own operating factors for estimating an annual emission factor. Values provided\nare at Standard Conditions (20°C, 101.325 kPa).\nNote: Emission factors are based upon a U.S. onshore context.\nEconomic Considerations\nThe cost for a dry seal system will depend on compressor operating pressure, shaft size, rotation speed,\nand other installation-specific factors. Tandem dry seals cost $10,800 to $13,500 per inch ($4,250 to\n$5,300 per centimeter) of shaft diameter.19 These costs will double for the more common beam-type\ncompressors with a seal on each end of the shaft. Other costs for dry seal systems include installation,\nengineering, and ancillary equipment.

Depending on location, type of equipment, number of controls, and availability\nof components, costs can range from $40,500 to $135,000 for the ancillary equipment.20\nOGMP estimates that costs for implementing dry seals is approximately $324,000 per compressor\n(including $162,000 in costs for two dry seals per compressor21 and $162,000 in other costs for\nengineering and equipment installation), based on replacing fully functioning wet seals.22\nWet seal systems may periodically need to be replaced for operational reasons. If this is the case, cost-\neffectiveness calculations should consider only the incremental cost of installing dry seals compared to\nsimply replacing the wet seals. The costs of replacing wet seals typically range between $6,750 and $8,100\nper inch ($2,660 and $3,190 per centimeter) of shaft diameter. Additional costs of ancillary equipment for\nwet seals could be up to $270,000, which would include the seal oil circulation pumps, oil heaters, fan\ncoolers, degassing unit, and controls.23 These ancillary facility costs are the same for both the single and\ndual seal compressor types. If wet seals were due to be replaced anyway, Partners may find that the cost\nof replacing wet seals with dry seals is not significantly more, and may select this option based on the\nadditional operational and emission reduction benefits.\nSavings from implementing this technology include reduced O&M costs and reduced natural gas losses\n(in relation to the case where the wet seal gas was routed to flare or vent, and not recovered for beneficial\nuse). Annual O&M costs can be as high as $140,000 for wet seals.24 However, since dry seals do not require\nas much equipment (e.g., oil pumps, heaters), power, and downtime, annual O&M costs for dry seals\ntypically range from $8,400 to $14,000.25 Therefore, Partners can save as much as $131,600 in O&M costs\nby not having to purchase replacement seal oil periodically and electricity to power seal oil pumps and\ncooling fans. Furthermore, Partners may save on compressor and pipeline maintenance as seal oil can clog\nand foul internal compressor parts and pipelines. These operational benefits of converting to dry seals are\nestimated to save approximately 20,000 Mscf (567 Mscm) of gas per year.26 At an assumed gas price of\n$3 per Mscf, that is equivalent to $60,000 in additional revenue.\nFor further information and detailed economic analysis, set up a free account with the Fluid Sealing\nAssociation to access the Lifecycle Cost Calculator.27\n20 Ibid.\n21 EPA.

It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describe established mitigation options that Partners should\nreference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the equipment and\nprocesses described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas operations, including\nonshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions are quantified and\nmitigated may vary across locations and operational environments. As such, operational conditions, as\nwell as logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP\nassumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-downs of non-redundant\nequipment/processes (e.g., that would result in a stoppage of operations) would be carried out during\nregularly scheduled maintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy\nof an early/additional shut-down.\nReciprocating compressors are found in a variety of oil and gas operations, both onshore and offshore.\nWhile the equipment may be similar, the way in which the emissions are quantified and mitigated may\nvary across activities and in particular from onshore to offshore. As such, operational conditions, as well\nas logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\nDescription of Source\nReciprocating compressors in the oil and gas industry commonly emit natural gas (where methane is the\nmain component) during normal operation and during standby under pressure. These emissions can be\nvented from the rod packing and blowdowns or as fugitives from the various compressor components.\nFigure 4.1 presents a typical compressor rod packing system. Flanges, valves, and fittings are all common\nsources for fugitive emissions from compressors, and are addressed in Technical Guidance Document\n(TGD) Number 2 “Fugitive Equipment and Process Leaks.” Experience indicates that fugitive leaks from\nthese compressor types are minimal. Piston rod packing systems, however, typically emit the highest\nvolume of gas for compressors in good repair and it is these emissions to which this TGD pertains.\nWhile reciprocating compressors can be found on offshore installations (e.g., in the North Sea basin),\ncompressors directly driven from turbines are far more common.\nBy design, rod packing systems emit small amounts of gas either into the distance piece or through a vent\nline connected to the packing case, or both. The piston rod packing itself is used to create a seal around\nthe piston rod tight enough to prevent large amounts of high-pressure gas leakage from the cylinder, but\nnot so tight as to bind the piston rod. A set of two or three flexible, segmented rings in a packing cup is\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\nPage 1 of 10",

A packing case has several cups, depending on the pressure in the\ncylinder. The machined face on each cup inhibits leakage between cups, and a nose gasket and flange\ngasket prevent leakage around the case. The rings are available in a variety of materials including bronze\nand carbon-impregnated Teflon.\nFigure 4.1: Typical Rod Packing System2\nAll packing systems leak under normal conditions, the amount of which depends on cylinder pressure,\nfitting and alignment of the packing parts, and amount of wear on the rings and rod shaft. A new packing\nsystem on small to medium size production compressors, properly aligned and fitted, may lose\napproximately 11 to 12 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) (0.5 standard cubic meters per hour (scm/h).3\nAs the system ages, however, leak rates will increase from wear on the packing rings and piston rod.\nLubricating oil injected into the packing helps seal the rings and cups, reduces wear caused by operation,\nand lowers heat build-up that accelerates ring wear. But over the thousands of hours of typical\ncompressor operation, rings wear and leakage increases. Average leakage of large, high-pressure\nreciprocating compressors ranges from 24 to 150 scfh (1 to 6 scm/h).4 One company has reported\nemissions of 900 scfh (30 scm/h) from one compressor rod packing.5 Factors other than normal wear can\nalso contribute to emissions, such as faulty installation and damaged components (cups, rings, gaskets).\nReciprocating compressors normally have multiple cylinders, and each cylinder piston rod has a packing\ncase.

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document\nNumber 4: Reciprocating Compressors\nOperational circumstances, including the possibility of stopping production (where redundancy is lacking),\nmay result in a situation where Partners need to weigh identified leakages against stopped production\nand emissions from the associated flaring. As a result of this assessment, the Partner may not mitigate\nthe leakages until the next maintenance stop, which could be some months away. This is often the case\nfor offshore operations, where production stops must be planned well in advance. As such, Partners\nshould view the combination of a fixed maintenance plan and gas recovery/routing to flare as the optimal\nmitigation option, where feasible from a cost/benefit standpoint.\nQuantification Methodology\nTo ensure consistent quantification of annual, volumetric, reciprocating compressor rod seal/packing vent\nmethane emissions and comparable evaluation of mitigation options, the CCAC OGMP recommends that\nPartners use one of the following two quantification methodologies for compressors operating more than\n26,000 hours (three years) between rod packing replacement. The quantification methodologies are\ndirect measurement and emission factor calculation. In principle, because leakages from rod packings\nincrease over the life of the packing, direct measurement is the most accurate method for quantifying\nmethane emissions. This method is however complex, if the packing vent does not have an in-line flow\nmeter or a measurement port for insertion of a measurement device such as an anemometer. 8 With direct\nmeasurement, Partners can be more certain of emission changes over the life of the packing, as well as\nthe economic costs and benefits relate to the timing of rod packing replacement (i.e., value of gas saved).\nAs such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever possible. Individual Partners may choose an\nalternative quantification methodology, if judged to be more accurate by the Partner; in this case, the\nPartner should document and explain the alternative methodology in the Annual Report.\nDirect measurements provide a flow rate for whole gas that is then converted to methane emissions using\nthe methane content of the gas being compressed. This flow rate can then be extrapolated over the entire\nyear. An annual volume of methane emissions is calculated by multiplying the measured whole gas\nemission flow rate during operation by the operating hours of the compressor plus the measured whole\ngas emission flow during shutdown while pressurized by the hours of standby-pressurized, and that sum\nmultiplied by the methane content of the whole gas. Other quantification methodologies are provided for\nsituations in which direct measurement is not feasible.\n Direct Measurement9\nPrior to measurement, the Partner should determine where the gas stream resulting from rod packing\nis routed. This determination will help ensure that the measurement point(s) are accurately identified.\nTypically, the emissions from a reciprocating compressor’s rod packing are routed through the vent\npipe connected to the packing case flange. However, gas can also leak along the rod or around the\nnose gasket at the end of the packing case (or both), thus bypassing the packing cup vent and entering\n8 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments, as per the instrument manufacturer\ninstructions. Measurements should also be conducted in operating and shutdown under pressure conditions, as such conditions\ncan affect emissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument use. Partners\nseeking to generate Emission Factors for their operation of compressors beyond 26,000 hours (three years) between packing\nreplacement should use direct measurement, based on a statistically sound number of measurements, as well as gas analyses to\nunderstand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\n9 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Subpart W – Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, Section 98.233 Calculating GHG\nEmissions, 40 CFR 98.233(p) Reciprocating Compressor Venting. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title40-\nvol21/pdf/CFR-2011-title40-vol21-sec98-233.pdf.\nPage 4 of 10",

Rod packing, being a dynamic seal, normally leaks more gas through the packing\ncase when the compressor is shut down and maintained at pressure than while operating. Leakages\nunder these conditions can be measured using the same method as for leakages during normal\noperations. Compressors housed in buildings normally have vents that are routed to the outside of\nthe building, often through the roof, and all cylinder packing vents are often manifolded together to\na single roof vent for each machine. Therefore, it may not always be clear which vent corresponds to\nwhich compressor packing. Consequently, Partners should always confirm a reciprocating\ncompressor’s vents by tracing piping from the source to the end point to avoid confusion. Where\npossible, Partners should review piping and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) drawings to confirm\nassumptions.\nViewing the vent and the compressor overall with an infrared (IR) leak imaging camera will identify\nemission points that should be measured. Main release points related to compressor venting are the\ncompressor distance piece vent and the packing vent. Partners should also review compressors where\nthe gas is routed to a combustion or utilization point other than the atmospheric vent (e.g.,\ncompressor suction, VRUs, low-pressure fuel gas, a flare) to identify any unexpected emissions.\nRecommended measurement tools include the following:\n Vane anemometer.\n Hotwire anemometer.\n Turbine meter.\n Calibrated bag.\n High-volume sampler.\n Acoustic detection device (for through-valve leaks).\n Orifice meter (vent flow measurement device).\nFor more details regarding each measurement tool, including applicability and measurement\nmethods, please refer to Appendix A.\n Emission Factor Approach:\nIf they do not select the direct measurement approach, Partners should use an emission factor\napproach to quantify average hourly (and yearly) emissions rates for compressors operating more\nthan 26,000 hours (three years) between rod packing replacement. Partners should apply an emission\nfactor that represents emissions of methane volume per year per compressor cylinder for rod packing,\nadjusted for the actual operating factor (including standby under pressure) of the compressor(s).\nPartners are encouraged to use emission factors that best represent the typical conditions and\npractices at their facilities.\nTable 4.2 presents default average hourly methane emission factors.

Any time-based rod packing replacement shorter\nthan this period, 26,000 operating hours (three years), is considered mitigated. Operating a rod packing\nbeyond this period would require the rod packing emissions measurement and economic analysis\ndescribed as Option A, in order to consider this source as mitigated. Rather than changing rod packing\nelements on a time- or operating hours-based schedule short of 26,000 hours, periodic inspection and\nmeasurement of the rod packing system enables Partners to identify when it is economical to replace the\nrings only, rings and cups, and piston rods, based on cost and the value of gas saved by replacement. Using\nan expected leak reduction value, a Partner can determine cost savings associated with\nmaintenance/replacement of excessively leaking packing systems/compressor components. To\ndetermine the expected leak reduction value, Partners should find the difference between the current\nleak rate and the initial leak rate measured at the last rod packing replacement22 (expected leak reduction\n= current leak rate – initial leak rate after the last rod packing replacement). Calculated leak reduction\nvalues may indicate the overall function of the rod packing systems as well as other components. For\nexample, a high emissions measurement from the compressor packing casing vent may indicate\nmaintenance requirements for packing system components only, and/or the piston rod, which is\nconsidered separate from the packing system. To establish the initial leak rate, Partners should measure\nrod packing emissions after one to two months of operation with new rings and with new rods installed\n(the time necessary to wear in new rings), creating a baseline value for comparing later leakage rates.\nOnce the expected leak reduction value is determined, Partners can apply a gas value to calculate cost\nsavings. Partners should consider replacing the piston rods and rings when the costs savings value is equal\nto or exceeds the equipment replacement cost.\nIt is important to note that this mitigation option is most appropriate for compressors which are spared,\nand thereby not deemed as critical (i.e., they can easily be stopped without affecting production). For\nunspared compressors that cannot easily be stopped for extended periods (to conduct maintenance),\nPartners should evaluate routing leaked gas to recovery or flares until the next scheduled shutdown.\nOperational Considerations\nDepending on how routine maintenance schedules are set, implementing this technology may involve\nmore frequent or less frequent replacement of packing components. Replaced equipment may include\npacking rings, cups, gaskets, and piston rods within the compressor. A measurement-/inspection-based\napproach to reciprocating compressor leakage mitigation as opposed to a routine time-based schedule\nensures that maintenance is performed as needed to prevent potential costly gas loss, unnecessary\nrepairs, and safety hazards associated with excessive leakages. Though compressor packing/packing\ncomponents as well as rods may typically be replaced according to a regular schedule, this method may\nnot take into account factors such as measured emission levels, improper installation/repairs performed\nas part of the previously scheduled maintenance periods (which may be duplicated and result in higher\nthan expected emissions), and changes in process conditions between maintenance periods (which may\nalso affect emission levels as well as choice of replacement materials).\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimates\nMany factors affect the potential emission reductions, including the leakage rate of newly installed\npacking, ring material, amount of wear on the rings, operating hours per year, condition of the piston rod\nsurface, amount of lubrication, and the fit and alignment of the packing system following new packing\ninstallation. Partners will determine the amount of methane emission reductions from replacing rod\n22 Ibid. 3, slide 8.\nPage 7 of 10",

Replacing/maintaining reciprocating compressor equipment is considered economical based\non results of a cost-benefit analysis of the value of gas saved (based on leak measurement) and expected\ncosts associated with equipment maintenance/replacement. When determining the associated costs\nrelated to equipment maintenance/replacement, Partners should include the costs associated with\nproduction stops, if such stops are required to carry out the maintenance/replacement.\nThe equipment replacement costs vary among different reciprocating compressor components. For\npacking rings, the number of compressor cylinders, number of cups per cylinder, and the ring material\ndetermine the cost of replacement. Piston rods might also need replacing, depending on condition. Worn\n(pitted, corroded, out-of-round) rods will also shorten the life of rings. According to Partner experience, a\ntypical Teflon 8- to 10-cup ring set ranges from about $1,350 to $1,700. For piston rods, the replacement\ncost is determined by the dimension and type of rod. Partners estimate the cost of rods to range from\n$2,400 to $4,700. Certain coatings such as tungsten carbide or chromium can increase the costs but\nextend the life of rods and rings as well. The labor cost to install a compressor rod is estimated as\napproximately equal to the cost of the compressor rod. The payback period of this opportunity will vary\ndepending on the expected leak reduction value.\nOnce the expected leak reduction and cost of replacements have been determined, Partners can\ndetermine an “economic replacement threshold” that will indicate when replacing packing rings (and\nrods, if necessary) is cost-effective.

In other words, when the\nleak reduction expected (calculated based upon measurements) is equal to or greater than the economic\nreplacement threshold of 2.2 scmh, Partners should replace the rings because the value of gas saved\nexceeds the cost to reduce the leakage.\nTable 4.3: Typical Economic Replacement Threshold for Packing Rings\nLeak Reduction Leak Reduction Payback Period\nExpected (scmh) Expected (scfh) (months)\n4.2 148 12\n2.2 78 24\n1.5 54 36\n1.2 43 48\n1.0 36 60\nNote: Assumes a gas value of $250/thousand scm ($3.00/Mscf) with 8,000 operating hours/year.\nFor additional information, see the Natural Gas STAR technical Document Reducing Methane Emissions\nfrom Compressor Rod Packing Systems (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-\n06/documents/ll_rodpack.pdf).\nMitigation Option B – Route reciprocating compressor “distance piece” or packing case vents (point\nwhere rod packing leakage exits the compressor) to useful outlet or flare.\nPartners can reduce venting emissions by routing gas to useful outlets, including a fuel gas system, a VRU,\nor a compressor inlet.

In evaluating potential inlet vent gas volume to the VRU, the Partner must ensure the\nVRU has sufficient capacity to accept the maximum anticipated volume from the compressor vent(s).\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nPage 9 of 10",

It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describes established mitigation options that Partners\nshould reference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the\nequipment and processes described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas operations,\nincluding onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions are quantified\nand mitigated may vary across locations and operational environments. As such, operational conditions,\nas well as logistical, safety, and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP\nassumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-downs of non-redundant\nequipment/processes (e.g., that would stop operations) would be carried out during regularly scheduled\nmaintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy of an early/additional\nshut-down.\nDescription of Source\nGlycol dehydrators in the natural gas industry have the primary purpose of removing water from an\nincoming wet gas stream using monoethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, or, most commonly, triethylene\nglycol (TEG). “Lean,” or dry, glycol is pumped via a pneumatic or electric pump to a gas contactor where\nit mixes with the natural gas stream. The glycol absorbs water from the gas stream, in addition to lesser\namounts of methane, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), producing\ndry gas and “rich,” or wet, glycol. Dehydrators can have a variety of configurations, which affect methane\nemission levels from their operation:\n Saturated glycol is sent to a regenerator/reboiler, where it is heated to boil off the water. In addition\nto the absorbed water, methane, HAPs, and VOCS are boiled off and routed with the steam to disposal\n(atmosphere, flare, etc.).\n Some dehydrators inject gas into the glycol feed to the regenerator to act as a “stripping gas” to aid\nin removing water from the glycol at a lower temperature. This gas vents with the steam and other\ngases.\n In the case of energy exchange pumps, the low-pressure glycol is pumped into the absorber by pistons\ndriven by the high-pressure glycol leaving the absorber. The additional gas necessary for a pneumatic\ngas-assisted glycol circulation pumps passes through the regenerator and vents with the steam as\nwell. In addition, the wet glycol can leak through the internal pump seals and contaminate the dry\nglycol, causing the dehydrator to operate less efficiently, requiring a higher circulation rate to achieve\ndry gas moisture specifications.\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\nPage 1 of 10",

A flash tank captures approximately 90 percent of the methane\nentrained by the TEG when using an energy exchange pump, but achieves only small reductions (some of\nthe dissolved hydrocarbons) using an electric pump. Replacing the energy assist circulation pump with an\nelectric pump will eliminate most of the methane, VOC, and HAP emissions from the dehydrator system\nwhen no stripping gas (natural gas) is used in the regenerator. Capturing, redirecting, or eliminating the\ndehydrator regenerator vent emissions to a useful outlet allows for significant fuel gas savings or gas\nmonetization. Putting an air condenser on the regenerator vent can condense the steam so that the non-\ncondensable methane can be recovered.\nGlycol dehydrator systems may be configured in a variety of ways. Some options include the following:\nTable 5.1: Configurations for Glycol Dehydrators\nConfiguration Mitigated or Unmitigated\nDehydrator does not have a flash tank separator and regenerator Unmitigated\nvents are routed to the atmosphere.

Even for “mitigated” configurations, Partners should evaluate the system 3 to ensure that it is\nfunctioning properly and minimizing methane emission levels.

In principle, direct measurement is the most accurate method for quantifying methane\nemissions.4 With direct measurement, Partners can be more certain of emissions levels and economic\ncosts and benefits (i.e., value of gas saved). As such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever\npossible. Individual Partners may choose an alternative quantification methodology if judged to be more\naccurate by the Partner; in this case, the Partner should document and explain the alternative\nmethodology in the Annual Report. Measurement is highly encouraged whenever possible. However,\nwithout a vent condenser on a glycol dehydrator, the vent temperature is above 250⁰F (120⁰C) and\ndifficult to measure or sample.\n Direct Measurement5:\nPrior to measurement, it is important to determine where the gas stream resulting from the\nregenerator is routed to help ensure that the measurement point(s) are accurately identified.\nViewing the glycol dehydrator system overall with an IR leak imaging camera will identify possible\nfugitive leak emissions. Because the regenerator vent with a vent air condenser can be well above\n140°F (60°C), the temperature above which personnel protection is required, Partners should confirm\nthat the tools being used can safely measure at these conditions. For hot vented gases, recommended\nmeasurements tools include the following:\n Vane anemometer.\n Hotwire anemometer.\n Turbine meter.\nFor more details regarding each measurement and detection tool, including applicability and\nmeasurement methods, please refer to Appendix A.\n Engineering Calculation with Software:\nFor triethylene glycol (TEG) systems, the best method for calculating glycol dehydrator emissions of\nmethane as well as VOCs and HAPs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) is GlyCalc®6. This model\nis not expensive and accurately calculates the quantity and composition of the hot vent stream with\ndifferent dehydrator configurations. Detailed information needed to run the simulation includes: wet\n4 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the instrument manufacturer\ninstructions. Measurements should also be conducted in different operating conditions, to the extent that those can affect\nemissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument use. Partners seeking to\ngenerate Emission Factors for their operations should use direct measurement based on a statistically sound number of\nmeasurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\n5 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Subpart W – Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems, Section 98.233 Calculating GHG\nEmissions, 40 CFR 98.233(e). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?SID=06f07ef849ab6de919f7c4c69e285d11&mc=true&node=se40.23.98_1223&rgn=div8.\n6 http://sales.gastechnology.org/000102.html.\nPage 3 of 10",

For ethylene glycol\nsystems GlyCalc can be used, however additional calculations using another tool (e.g. Aspen HYSYS)\nwill provide better estimate of emissions compounds.\n Emission Factor:\nIf direct measurement or engineering calculation with software is not selected, Partners can instead\nuse an emission factor method. Using this method, Partners apply an emission factor that represents\nemissions of methane volume per year per dehydrator, adjusted for the actual operating factor of the\ndehydrators. Partners are encouraged to use emission factors that best represent conditions and\npractices at their facilities. Table 5.2 presents default methane emission factors for glycol dehydrators.\nThe recommended methane emission factor varies by industry segment and do not include the\nemissions from gas-assisted glycol pumps or stripping gas, which can be a significant source of CH\n4\nemissions.\nTable 5.2: Default Emission Factors from Glycol Dehydrator Vents\nMethane Emission Factor7\nIndustry Segment\n(scm/MM scm throughput) (scf/MMscf throughput)\nProduction 275.6 275.6\nProcessing 121.6 121.6\nTransmission 93.72 93.72\nStorage 117.2 117.2\nMitigation Option A – Route flash tank (if present) and dehydrator regenerator vents to beneficial use,\nsuch as fuel gas (may require a vapor recovery unit (VRU)).\nRecovering gas that is otherwise vented to the atmosphere may allow for substantial costs savings. Having\na flash tank separator prior to the regenerator would allow Partners to capture the majority of the gas\nentrained in the glycol prior to reaching the regenerator and the opportunity to route the gas to a\nbeneficial use or to a flare. The recovered gas will contain methane as well as other heavier hydrocarbons.\nImplementing this system to recover gas from the regenerator and/or flash tank separator would involve\ninstalling additional piping and valves. The possible outlets for the recovered gas include a low-pressure\nfuel gas system, a VRU, compressor suction, and/or combustion in a flare.\nOperational Considerations\nMethane emissions from a dehydrator system are directly proportional to the glycol circulation rate in\nnormal continuous operation when no stripping gas (natural gas) is used in the regenerator. The rich glycol\ncontributes methane emissions from the regenerator vent. With higher circulation rates, these sources\ngenerate more emissions. When a stripping gas (natural gas) is injected in the regenerator of an\nunmitigated dehydrator system, it brings additional methane emissions which are proportional to the gas\ninjection flow rate. Many dehydrators are reported to be operating at a glycol circulation rate that is\nhigher than necessary to meet gas moisture specifications, which does little to improve the gas moisture\nquality but increases emissions. Therefore, Partners should consider optimizing/reducing the glycol\n7 EPA/GRI. Methane Emissions from the Natural Gas Industry: Volume 14 – Glycol Dehydrators, p. 23.

A VRU can\naccept additional gas lines of various pressures routed to a tank vapor space from which it takes suction.\nThe large volume and near atmospheric pressure of a tank vapor space acts to dampen variability of\nindividual gas stream flow rates. However, before the additional gas lines are added, Partners should\nconsider incoming gas composition and volume. The regenerator vent includes steam boiled out of the\nglycol and non-condensable hydrocarbons, including methane and the additional stripping gas (including\nmethane) if any. Glycol dehydrator regenerator vents should have a vent air condenser to knock out most\nof the steam and condensable hydrocarbons when routing to a VRU. The remaining hydrocarbon gas will\nbe richer in VOC and HAPs than the produced gas being dehydrated. The operator must ensure the VRU\nhas sufficient capacity to accept the additional gas.\nInstalling a flash tank separator between the gas contactor and the regenerator separates the excess gas,\nat a pressure that can deliver the gas to fuel, a low-pressure sales line, or compressor suction. A flash tank\nseparator separates gas and liquid at either the fuel gas system pressure or a compressor suction pressure\nof 40 to 100 psig (2.8 to 7 kg/cm2). At this lower pressure and without added heat, the gas is rich in\nmethane and lighter in VOCs, but water remains in solution with the TEG. The flash tank captures\napproximately 90 percent of the methane and 10 to 40 percent of the VOCs entrained by the TEG, thereby\nreducing emissions. The wet TEG, largely depleted of methane and light hydrocarbons, flows to the glycol\nregenerator/reboiler, where it is heated to boil off the absorbed water, remaining methane, and VOCs.\nThese gases are normally vented to the atmosphere and the lean TEG is circulated back to the gas\ncontactor.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nIn a flash tank separator, gas and liquid are separated at either the fuel gas system pressure or a\ncompressor suction pressure of 40 to 100 psig (2.8 to 7 kg/cm2). At this lower pressure and without added\nheat, the gas is rich in methane and lighter VOCs but water remains in solution with the TEG. The flash\ntank captures approximately 90 percent of the methane entrained by the TEG, thereby reducing emissions\nwhen that methane is routed to beneficial use.8\nWhen routing vents to a VRU, Partners can expect to reduce their methane emissions including those\ncoming from the stripping gas by approximately 95 percent (or more) from regenerator vents. This\nreduction percentage assumes VRUs operate 95 percent of the year, allowing for 5 percent of downtime\nfor VRU maintenance.\nEconomic Considerations\nThe costs for retrofitting a flash tank separator will vary significantly based on what a Partner already has\nin place. Information provided by flash tank separator manufacturing companies suggests an average\nequipment cost of the flash tank alone is $3,375 to $6,751. Installation costs up to 80 percent of vessel\ncost range from $1,684 to $3,031, including delivery, assembly, and labor costs.

Depending on gas value, the economic payback due to a\nrelatively small savings in methane emissions could justify these costs.\nFor more information, see Natural Gas STAR technical documents:\n Optimize Glycol Circulation And Install Flash Tank Separators In Glycol Dehydrators\n(https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/ll_flashtanks3.pdf).\n Reroute Glycol Skimmer Gas (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-\n06/documents/rerouteglycolskimmer.pdf).\n Pipe Glycol Dehydrator to Vapor Recovery Unit (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-\n06/documents/pipeglycoldehydratortovru.pdf).\nMitigation Option B – (a) Route flash tank (if present) and dehydrator still overheads to\nflare/combustion device, or (b) replace the gas assist lean glycol pump with an electric lean glycol pump.\nFlaring gas that is otherwise vented to the atmosphere may substantially reduce methane emissions.\nWhen a flash tank is present, the majority of the gas entrained in the wet glycol should be released from\nthe liquid stream prior to it reaching the regenerator. This provides the option for the gas to be re-routed\nfor beneficial use. The recovered gas will contain methane as well as other heavier hydrocarbons.\nImplementing this system to send vent gas to flare from the regenerator would involve installing\nadditional piping and valves. Using a gas assist lean glycol pump contributes methane emissions that could\nbe recovered, but replacing it with an electric lean glycol pump would eliminate most of those emissions,\nsaving a potentially significant quantity of gas rather than flaring it.\nOperational Considerations\nAs discussed under Mitigation Option A, methane emissions from an unmitigated dehydrator system\ndepend directly on the glycol circulation rate and stripping gas flow rate if any in normal continuous\noperation. Many dehydrators are reported to be operating at a glycol circulation rate that is higher than\nnecessary to meet gas moisture specifications, which does little to improve the gas moisture quality but\nincreases emissions. Therefore, Partners should consider optimizing/reducing the glycol circulation rate\nto reduce emissions at a negligible cost while still meeting moisture specifications.\nWhen considering an electric pump for replacement, Partners will need to have a reliable source of\nelectricity available. Power can be purchased or generated onsite using recovered gas. After determining\nan adequate power source, Partners need to determine the correct pump size using the circulation rate\nand operating pressure of the dehydrator system.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nAfter implementing this technology, Partners can expect to reduce methane emissions by approximately\n98 percent from sending recovered gas to flare. The reduction estimate is based on typical flare\ncombustion efficiency of 98 percent and regenerator vent gas composition of 50 percent methane.\nPartners should calculate their estimated reductions according to the flare efficiency and methane\ncomposition of vent gas in their operations.\nEconomic Considerations\nPage 6 of 10",

    "text": "Number 6: Unstabilized Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage Tanks\nSG. 17.1.6\nTECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT NUMBER 6:\nUNSTABILIZED HYDROCARBON LIQUID STORAGE TANKS\nIntroduction\nThis document provides technical guidance to Partners of the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership\n(OGMP). It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describes established mitigation options that Partners\nshould reference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the\nequipment and processes described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas operations,\nincluding onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions are quantified\nand mitigated may vary across locations and operational environments. As such, operational conditions,\nas well as logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP\nassumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-downs of non-redundant\nequipment/processes (e.g., that would result in a stoppage of operations) would be carried out during\nregularly scheduled maintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy\nof an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nStorage vessels in the oil and natural gas sector are used to hold a variety of liquids, including crude oil,\ncondensates, and produced water. Crude oil and condensate may be stored in fixed-roof, atmospheric\npressure tanks between production wells and pipeline or truck transportation. In offshore fields, the\nstorage tanks on production platforms, floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels and\nfloating storage and offloading (FSO) vessels contain crude oil and/or condensate, produced from\nconnected wells or coming from nearby platforms. Light hydrocarbons dissolved in the crude oil or\ncondensate under pressure (i.e. unstabilized hydrocarbon liquids)—including methane and other volatile\norganic compounds (VOC), natural gas liquids (NGLs), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and some inert\ngases—will flash (vaporize) from the liquid stored in the tank and accumulate in the vapor space between\nthe liquid surface, the walls and roof of the tank. Fixed roof tanks can not contain any significant pressure\nabove atmospheric pressure, and therefore these vapors must be vented.\nEmissions from storage vessels are a combination of flash, working, and standing losses. Flash losses (the\nmost significant of the three) occur when a pressurized liquid with dissolved gases is transferred from a\nwell or vessel at higher pressure to a fixed roof, atmospheric pressure tank. The pressure drop causes gas\nto rapidly evolve from the liquid and/or vaporize (i.e., flash). Working losses refer to vapors above the\nliquid surface pushed out by rising liquid levels and agitation of liquids in tanks associated with circulation\nof fresh liquid through them. Standing losses refer to vapors expanding and venting associated with daily\nand seasonal temperature and barometric pressure changes. Onshore field production sites are generally\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\nPage 1 of 13",

This results in some flashing emissions.\nThe volume of vapor emitted from a fixed-roof storage tank is dependent on several factors, most\nsignificantly the pressure in the gas/liquid separator and the oil or condensate flow rate from this\nseparator into the tank. That is, the greater the differential in pressure between the separator and tank,\nthe higher the flashing losses. Lighter crude oils (API gravity >36°) flash more hydrocarbon vapors than\nheavier crudes (API gravity <36°) at the same separator pressure. Additionally, in storage tanks where oil\ncycling is frequent and overall throughput is high, more working losses will occur than in tanks with low\nthroughput and where oil is held for longer periods of time.\nThe composition of tank vapors varies based on the type of production and the types of hydrocarbons\nthat are being produced from the reservoir. Often methane is the primary component of tank vapors\n(between 40 and 80 percent for crude oil and gas condensate), but other compounds may be present in\nlesser quantities, including more complex hydrocarbon compounds such as ethane, propane, butanes,\npentanes, natural inert gases such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and hazardous air pollutants, like\nhydrogen sulfide, benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene.\nHydrocarbon liquid storage tanks may be configured in a variety of ways, and the configuration should be\nidentified to determine whether the source is mitigated or unmitigated. Some options include the\nfollowing:\nTable 6.1: Configurations for Unstabilized Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage TanksA\nConfiguration Mitigated or Unmitigated\nTank vapors are emitted to the atmosphere via routing through an\nopen vent, unlit flare2, and/or through openings in the fixed roof of an\noil or condensate production tank (e.g., open/unsealed thief hatch, Unmitigated\ncracks/corrosion in tank roof, weighted pressure/vacuum relief valve).\nExhibit A\nMitigated (if confirmed to be\nTank vapors are recovered by routing to a Vapor Recovery Unit (VRU)\nfunctioning with lowB or no\nsystem and directing to productive use (e.g., fuel gas, compressor\nemissions)\nsuction, gas lift).

Note that unstabilized oil cannot be stored in a floating roof tank.\nBExpected emissions levels if mitigation option is in place and functioning properly (e.g., flare is not extinguished,\netc.).\nPartners should quantify and evaluate for mitigation any of the configurations above that are not\nidentified as “mitigated” for methane emissions, per the sections below. As part of their periodic\nevaluation plans, Partners should include inspection of mitigated tanks in their Annual Operations/Assets\nSurveys to ensure proper functionality. Malfunctions (e.g., VRU or stabilization towers are not functioning\nor an extinguished flare) may result in higher than designed methane emissions. Though unusual,\nsituations have also been observed in which gas from the separator is permanently routed to the\natmosphere (e.g., when there is no market for the gas), in which case this should count as an additional\nsource of “unmitigated” emissions that needs to be quantified and addressed.\nAt times, unintended methane emissions not associated with crude oil or condensate flashing may enter\nand vent from tanks. For example, if a gas/oil separator dump valve sticks open due to physical erosion\nof valve seats or solids plugging or liquids freezing in the valve that prevents the valve from closing, bulk\ngas can be entrained with the oil to the tank resulting in methane emissions exceeding calculated flashing\nlosses. Because the source of emissions is not at the dump valve, and vent emissions from an unmitigated\nor malfunctioning mitigated tank is assumed to come from the separator liquid, fugitive emissions\nmonitoring may not identify this through-valve leaking component: it is related to tank operations.\nPartners should identify this malfunctioning source during tank inspection and repair or report emissions\nunder the FUGITIVE COMPONENT AND EQUIPMENT LEAKS source as part of the Directed Inspection &\nMaintenance (DI&M) programs.\nQuantification Methodology\nTo ensure consistent quantification of annual volumetric unstabilized hydrocarbon liquid storage tank\nmethane emissions and comparable evaluation of mitigation options, the OGMP recommends that\nPartners use one of the quantification methodologies discussed below. In principle, direct measurement\nin conjunction with vent gas composition analysis is the most accurate method for quantifying methane\nemissions from flashing losses with a uniform crude oil input.3 However, standing and working losses are\nless accurately quantified by direct measurement and with changes in crude oil from multiple wells. With\ndirect measurement, and through taking steps to stop potential gas bypass and accounting for working\nlosses, Partners can be more certain of emissions levels and economic costs and benefits (i.e., value of gas\nsaved). As such, measurement related to crude oil throughput is encouraged whenever possible.\nTo achieve some level of consistency within the Methane Partnership, partner companies are encouraged\nto use one of the following methodologies in order to facilitate consistent, comparable approaches to\nquantifying emissions levels and evaluating potential reduction volumes. Individual companies may\nchoose an alternative quantification methodology if judged to be more accurate by the company, in which\ncase the alternative methodology will be documented and explained in the Annual Report.\n3 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the instrument manufacturer\ninstructions. Measurements should also be conducted in different operating conditions, to the extent that those can affect\nemissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument use. Partners seeking to\ngenerate Emission Factors for their operations should use direct measurement based on a statistically sound number of\nmeasurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\nPage 3 of 13",

    "text": "Number 6: Unstabilized Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage Tanks\n Direct Measurement4:\nWhen quantifying emissions via measurement, the first step is identifying the point(s) where\nemissions are occurring. Observing the tank roof and tank vent (if routed away from the tank) with an\ninfrared (IR) leak imaging camera (designed to visually identify hydrocarbon emissions) both before\nand during measurement will show locations where gas is venting. Partners can use other portable\ninstruments if an IR camera is not available (i.e., FID detector). A measurement is commonly taken\ndirectly from the vent of a storage tank using a flow totalizing turbine meter. Partners can also route\nflow from an open thief hatch to a measurement device (e.g., by attaching a length of piping to a\nflange that can be sealed to an open thief hatch and measuring the emissions coming through the\npiping).\nPartners should conduct the measurement over a long enough period to account for variability in flow\nduring tank filling and pump-out (e.g., 3 to 24 hours). Partners can determine an appropriate time\nperiod on an individual basis, such that the long-term measurement allows for an evaluation of\nemissions levels during tank filling and pump-out operations. These measurements will provide the\ntotal gas flow rate relative to oil input, which is then converted to methane emissions using the\nmethane content of the gas. The methane flow rate should be extrapolated to account for an entire\nyear of normal operations. The annual volume of methane emitted is calculated by taking the\nmeasured average methane emissions flow rate divided by oil input, and multiplying this ratio by the\nannual throughput of the storage tank(s).\nIt should be noted that the slight back-pressure of a turbine meter will push emissions out other\nopenings, such as corrosion holes in the roof or the thief hatch if not sealed tightly. Viewing the tank\nwith an IR camera during measurement will allow Partners to identify those other escape points and\ntake measures to suppress or plug those vents during the measurement. Alternative options may\ninclude: high flow samplers; traditional bagging techniques; positive displacement metering such as\nwet and dry gas meters with data-logging capability.\nNote that the gas/oil separator vessel liquid level control valve can leak or stick open, whereby gas is\nentrained with the oil delivered to the tank. Increased emissions from storage tanks above what can\nbe accounted for by flashing at separator pressure and temperature may be due to this leakage and\nalso from vortexing when the separator liquid level is very low and there is no vortex breaker installed\nin the liquid drain nozzle. A leaking, stuck-open valve and vortexing can also contribute to increased\nemissions from compressor suction scrubber dump valves that drain to a fixed roof tank. This is easily\navoided by observing that the gas/oil separator maintains a liquid level in the sight-glass during tank\nemissions measurement.\nPartners can obtain a value for methane emissions using the total vapor flow over a recorded time\nand knowledge of the composition of the vapors in the tank. As noted above, emissions from storage\ntanks are not limited to the vent and also can come from defects in the tanks, including but not limited\nto, visible cracks, holes, gaps in piping, loose connections, broken or missing caps, a leaking\npressure/vacuum safety valve (weighted vent valve such as an ENARDO valve), loose or open thief\n4 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, Subpart W – Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems.

Depending on the location of a leak and piping/vent configuration of\na storage tank and the gas flow rate, Partners can also take an emissions measurement using a\ncalibrated vent bag or an anemometer (vane or hotwire). Recommended measurement tools include\nthe following:\n Turbine meter\n Calibrated vent bag\n Vane anemometer\n Hotwire anemometer\n High volume sampler\nFor more details regarding each measurement tool including applicability and measurement methods,\nplease refer to Appendix A.\n Estimation Methods:\nPartners can calculate flashing, working, and standing emissions from liquid transferred to storage\ntanks with equation of state programs, such as AspenTech HYSYS® or E&P TANKS5, or empirical\nequations, such as Vasquez-Beggs or the Griswold and Ambler GOR Chart methods. Typically, a\nminimum of the following parameters/operating conditions are necessary to characterize emissions\nusing computer programs or charts: (1) separator pressure and temperature, (2) sales oil or stabilized\noil American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity, (3) sales oil or stabilized oil production rate, (4) ambient\nair pressure and temperature, and (5) separator oil composition and Reid vapor pressure.6 Note that\nif separator oil composition and Reid vapor pressure data are not available, one option is to select\ndefault values in the E&P TANKS program that most closely match separator pressure first, and API\ngravity second. Partners can also input more detailed information into the models. With additional\ndata concerning crude oil property changes, tank size, shape, color, and internal and ambient\ntemperatures, computer models can produce more accurate emissions estimates over the course of\na year than direct measurement. Note that software cannot characterize separator or scrubber dump\nvalve leakage, which can far exceed flashing losses. Comparing direct measurement results with\nsoftware calculation has revealed many instances of higher emissions possibly from dump valve\nleakage.\n Lab Analysis:\nAnother alternative for estimating emissions from storage tanks is to obtain a sample of the oil in the\nseparator and perform a lab analysis to determine how much methane will be vented from this sample\nas the pressure drops to tank pressure (atmospheric). Partners can then apply this ratio to the volume\nof oil entering the tank, and the subsequent volume of emissions can be assumed to be the vented\nvolume.7 Nearly all methane will flash out of solution from oil at atmospheric pressure, so this method\nis the least complicated in estimating methane emissions, but does not accurately characterize total\ngas emissions (which is necessary to economically evaluate mitigation options).\n5 American Petroleum Institute “E&P TANKS v3.0.” https://www.eptanks.com/\n6 EPA.

Partners need to\ndo this only if they are not using direct measurement to quantify methane emissions from storage\ntanks (direct measurement occurs at the storage tank atmospheric vent, and scrubber dump valve\nemissions go through the same vent and are therefore included). If Partners use software or lab\nanalysis, then they should also use this method to avoid underestimating emissions from storage\ntanks (if a scrubber dump valve is indeed confirmed stuck open). Partners can use the equation below\nto estimate emissions from stuck-open valves on well pad gas-liquid separators and scrubbers:\n𝐸 𝐸\n𝑛 𝑛\n𝐸 = (𝐶𝐹 × ×𝑇 )+( ×(8760−𝑇 ))\n𝑠,𝑖 𝑛 8760 𝑛 8760 𝑛\nWhere:\nE = Annual total volumetric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at standard conditions from\ns,i\neach storage tank (scf).\nE = Storage tank emissions as determined via calculation, software, or lab analysis (scf/y).\nn\nT = Total time the dump valve is not closing properly in the calendar year (hours).

A\nVRU first draws hydrocarbon vapors out of a fixed roof storage tank under low pressure, typically between\n4 ounces and 2 psi (0.0175 and 0.14 kg/cm2) gauge pressure, and routes them through a separator (suction\nscrubber) to a specifically designed wet gas compressor. Proper design includes routing the suction line\nwith only a downward slope to the suction scrubber so that a liquid trap does not occur that would inhibit\n8 EPA.

From the compressor, the vapors are routed to their desired location(s)\nwithin the facility: a gas sales line, local fuel, and/or suction of a production or gas lift compressor. The\nliquids from a separator can be returned to the oil storage tank or collected separately and sold to a\nprocessing plant or refinery for a premium price. The recovered vapors are rich in propane, butanes, and\nnatural gasoline and will therefore have higher heat content and a higher value to gas processing plants\nthan pipeline quality natural gas.\nOperational Considerations\nVirtually any tank battery is a potential site for a VRU. Two indicators of a potential VRU project are a\nregular and sufficient quantity of crude oil and/or condensate production and an economic outlet for\ncollected products. Note that a source of electricity is highly desired to power several of the VRU’s\ncomponents. Included in a standard VRU are:\n Sloping downward suction pipeline manifolded to all tanks.\n Suction scrubber (separator).\n Compressor (typically electric-driven rotary vane, screw, or scroll compressor).\n Liquid transfer pump.\n Electronic Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).\n Associated discharge piping, instruments, valves, and controls.\nPeriodic, large flow of liquids out of the storage tanks during pump-out can cause large and rapid\nfluctuations in tank pressure, putting stress on the VRU. Partners may consider installing a vapor recovery\ntower (VRT) to ensure the VRU operates at steady state within its design capacity even with the rapid\nchanges in pressure with liquids flow out of the storage tank(s). This is an inexpensive way to elevate the\ncrude oil or condensate gas/oil separation and flash gas generation above the tank to isolate the vapor\nrecovery from tank liquid movements. Working and standing losses are minimal from low vapor pressure\noil gravity draining into the tank.\nWet screw compressors are often chosen for VRU applications for their ability to achieve high\ncompression ratios (up to 20 in a single stage)9 due to the injection of a significant amount of coolant into\nthe compressor chamber. While this coolant injection lowers gas discharge temperature and improves\ncompressor efficiency, the volume increase caused by the coolant decreases the effective volume for gas.\nPartners should model screw compressor performance using both factors.\nThe optimal adiabatic efficiency for a single stage screw compressor is achieved at approximately a 3:1\npressure ratio,10 although higher pressure ratios are achievable without sacrificing significant efficiency,\ngiven suitable discharge temperature and motor limitations (typical motor operates at 3600 rpm).\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nIdeally, in the correct operating condition, VRUs can recover nearly all vapors from a storage tank. Based\non a VRU operating factor of 95 percent (allowing 5 percent yearly downtime of the VRU for\nmaintenance), Partners can expect to reduce methane emissions from a storage tank by 95 percent after\nimplementing this technology.\n9 Hanlon, Paul C.

    "text": "Number 6: Unstabilized Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage Tanks\nEconomic Considerations\nThe cost of a VRU is dependent on several design/operational factors, including gas throughput to the\nVRU, inlet and desired outlet temperatures and pressures for the system, and composition(s) of the gas\nbeing recovered. Partners should size a VRU to handle the maximum volume of vapors expected from the\nstorage tanks (a rule of thumb is to double the average daily volume). Partners should optimize VRU design\nand cost to maximize emission capture and minimize costs, for example by routing emissions from several\ntanks to a single VRU. In considering VRU sizing, Partners should consider production forward planning,\nso that the VRU can handle planned increased production to the tank battery. Also, a VRU can recover\nother vented or flared gas streams at a facility. This would enable Partners to capture these additional gas\nstreams that are currently being lost to the atmosphere and can improve a proposed project’s economics.\nPartners would need to account for the maximum throughputs associated with these gas streams in the\ninitial VRU design. Examples include pneumatic device vents, compressor rod packing vents, Glycol\nDehydrator vent (with a vent condenser), and controlled equipment blowdowns.\nEstimated VRU and associated installation costs for 25 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/day) and\n500 Mcf/day throughputs (708 standard cubic meters per/day and 14,158 scm/day) are approximately\n$35,000 and $105,000, respectively.11,12 Partner and VRU manufacture experience has shown that\ninstallation costs range between 50 to 100 percent of the initial VRU equipment cost (75 percent was\nchosen for economic estimates provided here). Yearly operation (primarily electricity) and maintenance\ncosts (O&M) associated with these VRU capacities are $7,400 and $16,800, respectively.13 Note that the\nVRU costs provided are for recovery of hydrocarbon vapors at atmospheric pressure and approximately\n70 °F (21 °C) for discharge into a typical sales gas line up to approximately 100 psig pressure and 212 °F\n(100 °C) temperature. Discharging gas at pressures above 100 psig (7 kg/cm2) will likely involve a two-\nstage compressor.\nNote that installation costs can vary widely depending primarily on the location of a site (VRU installation\nat remote sites will likely incur higher costs) and number of tanks being connected to the VRU system.\nO&M costs vary depending on the location of the VRU system (VRUs installed in a cold climate experience\nmore wear), the quality of the gas (high acid content, CO and/or H S have higher corrosion rates),\n2 2\nelectricity costs, and oil produced (paraffinic oil can clog VRUs more frequently and therefore require\nincreased maintenance).14\nGas value savings associated with installing a VRU take into account recovered high BTU gas and the value\nof the recovered NGLs in the tank vapors. In most vapor recovery applications, the value of the recovered\ngas stream is rarely due to the value of methane alone as most tank vapors contain varying amounts of\nethane, propane, butane, pentanes, and other “heavy” hydrocarbons. For those Partners that have a gas\nsales contract that is based upon the heating value (BTU content) of the gas, “wet gas” may sell for\nupwards of 2.5 times an equivalent volume of pipeline quality natural gas.\n11 EPA.

    "text": "Number 6: Unstabilized Hydrocarbon Liquid Storage Tanks\nFor reference, using E&P TANKS software, for a tank holding a medium crude (30° API) at atmospheric\npressure and 70° F (21 °C), the mole composition of vapors is approximately 68 percent methane, 10\npercent ethane, 8 percent propane, and 3 percent each butane and isobutene. Based on these\ncompositions, for VRU capacities of 25 Mcf/day and 500 Mcf/day (708 scm/day and 14,158 scm/day), the\nyearly values of these recovered gas streams12, 15 are approximately $30,000 and $600,000 at $7/Mcf of\nrich tank vapors, respectively. For Partners who have access to natural gas liquid plants, tank vapors could\nprovide a source to feed these plants. For the same mole composition references above and vapor flow\nrates of 25 Mcf/day and 500 Mcf/day (708 scm/day and 14,158 scm/day), the approximate values of\nrecoverable NGLs (C to C ) are $60,000/year and $340,000/year, respectively.16\n2 4\nFor more information, see Natural Gas STAR technical document “Installing Vapor Recovery Units on\nStorage Tanks” (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/ll_final_vap.pdf).\nMitigation Option B – Install stabilization towers ahead of tanks to reduce the amount of entrained gas\nand flash gas emitted from the tank(s).\nIn petroleum and gas production facilities, the primary purpose of stabilization towers is to obtain a low\noil vapor pressure suitable for loading onto ships and barges or extract more high-value natural gas liquids\nfor gas processing. In gas processing facilities, the purpose of stabilization towers is to separate heavier\nhydrocarbons and lighter fractions (C to C ) prior to transporting and storing crude oil and condensate.\n1 4\nIn either case, the process separates the lightest liquid component (pentane) and heaviest gas component\n(butane) through distillation.17 Stabilization towers installed ahead of crude oil storage tanks can serve a\nsimilar function as vapor recovery units in reducing methane emissions from storage tanks, with the\nadditional feature that they can reduce the crude oil vapor pressure below atmospheric pressure.\nStabilization removes virtually all methane from the crude oil or condensate.\nCrude oil or condensate enters the top of stabilization towers and flows down a series of trays. When\npressurized oil enters the low-pressure column, flashed vapors exit the top of the tower while “stabilized”\ncrude oil or condensate passes through the bottom of the tower(s) and into storage. Adding a reboiler on\nthe bottom of the column creates vapor traffic up the tower to strip more light hydrocarbons out of the\noil, and reduces the vapor pressure on the crude product below atmospheric. In addition to the heated\nreboiler, a stripping gas such as steam may be added near the bottom of the column to provide increased\nvapor flow and enhance light hydrocarbon (C to C ) removal.\n1 4\nGiven the utility of stabilization towers, some Partners already have them installed and functioning. This\ntechnology is considered “mitigated” for methane with regards to liquid petroleum product storage tanks.\nThe possible outlets for the recovered gas from stabilization towers include being sent to a gas processing\nfacility, a fuel gas line, a VRU, and/or combustion in a flare. Because stabilization towers are expensive\nand installed for the specific purposes listed above, it is not anticipated that Partners will install them as\na retrofit for the sole purpose of controlling methane emissions from tanks.\n15 NGL values obtained from EPA presentation: Vapor Recovery Tower/VRU Configuration: Lessons Learned from Natural Gas\nSTAR.

A flare may continuously receive vent streams from one or\nseveral processes and/or pieces of equipment at a facility.\nOperational Considerations\nVirtually any vented storage tank’s vapors with minimal sulfur content can be routed to an existing flare\nby installing piping which route the vapors to the flare. It is absolutely essential to include a flame arrestor\nin the flare line near the tank as air drawn into an atmospheric pressure storage tank can form explosive\nmixtures that could flash-back from the flare flame and explode the tank. If routing to an existing flare is\noperationally infeasible, a new flare system requires installation of the following equipment:\n Flare stack.\n Associated piping used to direct vapors from storage tank(s) to the flare.\n Flame arrestor.\nGas-fired flares may have one or more continuously burning pilot flames or be ignited with an electric\nspark-ignition system.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nCompanies can expect to achieve a 98 percent reduction in methane emissions from routing storage tank\nvapors to a flare, assuming a properly operated flare (98 percent combustion efficiency).18\nEconomic Considerations\nMinimal capital costs are associated with routing storage tank vapors to an existing flare. These costs\ninclude all piping connections and labor required to route vapors from the tank vent(s) to the flare gas\nline. For a new flare system, estimated total capital investment for a new flare and flame arrestor,\nincluding an auto-igniter, and associated freighting, design, and installation is estimated to be $24,300.19\nAnnual costs are estimated to be approximately $1,800/year for pilot fuel (assuming $3/Mcf) and flare\nsystem maintenance.\nThough flaring achieves no economic benefit in terms of gas saved, a flare is an important\noperational/safety device at a natural gas/oil installation as it can serve as a safe gas disposal outlet for\nover-pressurized equipment as well as a gas outlet for equipment undergoing maintenance and repairs,\nthus reducing methane emissions from these sources by combusting the gas.

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document Number 7: Well Venting for\nLiquids Unloading\nSG.17.1.7\nTECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT NUMBER 7:\nWELL VENTING FOR LIQUIDS UNLOADING\nIntroduction\nThis document provides technical guidance to Partners of the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership\n(OGMP). It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describes established mitigation options that Partners\nshould reference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the\nequipment and processes described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas\noperations, including onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions\nare quantified and mitigated may vary across locations and operational environments. As such,\noperational conditions, as well as logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a\ncase-by-case basis. The OGMP assumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-\ndowns of non-redundant equipment/processes (e.g., that would result in a stoppage of operations)\nwould be carried out during regularly scheduled maintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the\ncorrective action to be worthy of an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nOver time, gas production naturally declines in non-associated gas wells as the reservoir is depleted.\nInitial flow (gas velocity) from a gas well is usually sufficient to entrain produced liquids as droplets\nand carry them through the wellhead and to a separator. However, as flow declines, the gas velocity\nmay be insufficient to lift the produced liquid, and liquid may accumulate in the wellbore. As liquid\naccumulates in non-associated gas wells, the pressure of the liquid becomes greater than the gas\nvelocity and eventually slows or stops the flow of gas to the sales line. These gas wells therefore often\nneed to remove or “unload” the accumulated liquids so that gas production is not inhibited. Well\nliquids must be managed on an ongoing basis and adapted to the changes in wells’ flow characteristics\nas wells move through their lifecycle.\nFour main flow regimes normally occur in a gas well: mist flow, annular flow, slug flow, and bubble\nflow. Mist flow, where the gas flows and carries the liquids in mist form, is ideal. Annular flow is slower\nthan mist flow. In annular flow, the lighter gas travels up the center of the well tubing and the heavier\nliquids flow along the walls of the tubing. At still slower velocities, called slug flow, liquids separated\nby pockets of gas flow up the tubing. Finally, at even slower velocities, the gas flows according to what\nis known as bubble flow. In bubble flow, the gas is dispersed in the liquid phase and flows at a very\nslow rate. In this phase, the gas is no longer carrying the liquids through the tubing, resulting in\naccumulation of the liquids.2\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\n2 Guo, Boyun; Ghalambor, Ali; Natural Gas Engineering Handbook, pgs. 241–254.\nPage 1 of 18",

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document Number 7: Well Venting for\nLiquids Unloading\nBecause fluids slow the gas velocity, their build-up needs to be addressed. Partners can choose from\nseveral techniques to remove the liquids, including manual unloading, foam agents, velocity tubing or\nvelocity strings, beam or rod pumps, electric submergence pumps (ESP), intermittent unloading, gas\nlift, and wellhead compression, as liquids unloading practices. Each method removes accumulated\nliquids and thereby maintains or restores gas production. Below is a summary of these methods:\n “Manual Liquids Unloading with Atmospheric Venting”- The well is choked with liquids built\nup in the tubing, substantially reducing or stopping gas production to the sales line. At that\ntime, the sales line connection is manually shut-off, and well production is routed to an\natmospheric tank with lower back-pressure than the production system. This allows reservoir\n(gas) pressure to lift the liquid from the well. The entrained gas is vented to the atmosphere\nat the tank. Subsequently the well is manually rerouted to the production system and sales\ngas line. In some cases, the well is shut-in for a period of time to build-up pressure before\nbeing routed to an atmospheric tank.\n “Manual Liquids Unloading without Atmospheric Venting”- The well is shut-in before liquids\nchoke off gas flow, allowing the reservoir pressure to rise to shut-in pressure. The well is re-\nopened and flow routed to the separator with gas going to sales and liquids to storage.\n “Automated Liquids Unloading”- Similar to manual unloading without atmospheric venting,\nexcept a timing and/or pressure device is used to optimize intermittent shut in of the well\nbefore liquids choke off gas flow. The reservoir pressure rises sufficiently to lift liquids to the\nseparator (gas to sales without atmospheric venting) or direct liquids to an atmospheric\nstorage tank (substantially less entrained gas vented to the atmosphere).\n “Foaming Agents”- Chemicals are added to the well that reduce the liquid density through\nfoaming, which improve the ability of the gas to carry the liquids to the surface.\n “Velocity Tubing or Strings”- Installation of several smaller sized tubing strings in place of the\nsingle larger production tubing increases gas flow velocity in each small tube, thus allowing\nthe well’s gas flow to carry the liquids out.\n “Plunger Lift System”- A mechanical system with an automated controller that can close in the\nwell, allowing the plunger to drop to the bottom of the well. The controller then reopens the\nwell, allowing the gas to push the plunger to the top with a slug of liquid on top. The controller\ncan be activated manually, by a mechanical timer, by a pressure controllers, or with an\nautomated “smart” cycle system. Depending on the plunger system design and operation,\nplunger controllers may be designed to allow automatic venting if the plunger does not return\nwhen expected, thus creating an emission during some plunger trips. Other systems are\ndesigned to vent on every plunger lift trip.\n “Sucker Rod or Beam Pumps”- Installation of a rod pump system to lift liquids up the tubing\nthrough a series of check valves.

These\nquantification methodologies include: direct measurement, engineering calculation, or emission\nfactor approach. Individual Partners may choose an alternative quantification methodology if judged\nto be more accurate by the Partner; in this case, the Partner should document and explain the\nalternative methodology in the Annual Report.\n3 Partners should conduct measurements with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the instrument manufacturer\ninstructions. Measurements should also be conducted in different operating conditions, to the extent that those can affect\nemissions levels. Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents includes guidance on instrument use. Partners seeking\nto generate Emission Factors for their operations should use direct measurement based on a statistically sound number of\nmeasurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\nPage 4 of 18",

The thief hatch is typically manually\nopened just for the duration of the unloading operation. However, each facility setup is unique, and\nsome sites have dedicated open top tanks or other openings in the tank. It may be necessary for\nPartners to review the site flow during unloading activities. Viewing the vent with an infrared leak-\nimaging camera can also identify emission points that should be measured. After reviewing the site\nflow configuration and determining the emission location(s), then Partners can directly measure the\nflow from the emission point(s) with a temporary flow meter stack or can insert a flow meter\nupstream of the emission point within the process piping using a generally accepted meter, such as:\n Vane anemometer\n Hotwire anemometer\n Turbine meter\nThe measured flow rate then is used in the following equation to obtain the annual emissions. The\nwhole gas emissions can then be multiplied by the methane composition to calculate the annual\nmethane emissions.\n𝐸 = 𝐹 𝐹𝑅\n𝑎 𝑝\nWhere:\nE = Annual whole gas emissions at standard conditions in cubic feet (scf).\na\nF = Frequency of the venting events (number of occurrences per year).\np\nFR = Cumulative whole gas flow rate in cubic feet at standard conditions over the\nduration of the liquids unloading event (scf).\nNote that the frequency of events, Fp, can be gathered from a number of approaches. In cases of\nmanual venting, this will require data gathering from a log of manually initiated events. In the case\nof automated venting of plunger lift systems, this frequency can likely be collected directly from\nthe plunger controller, which logs the number of events where the plunger did not return in the\nexpected period and when the controller vented the well as a result.\n Engineering Calculation: If the direct measurement approach is not selected or is not feasible\nor practical, an engineering calculation approach can be used.

An emission factor\nthat represents emissions of methane volume per year per well or per event should be applied for\nliquids unloading, adjusted for operating parameters. Operating parameters include whether the well\ndoes or does not have a plunger lift and the frequency of vented events. Partners are encouraged to\nuse emission factors that best represent conditions and practices at their facilities. Default methane\nemission factors are provided in Tables 7.2-7.48.\nMitigation Methodologies\nThe following are example mitigation methodologies that may reduce emissions associated with well\nliquids unloading. Note that each of these mitigation strategies is not universally applicable and will\nonly apply to wells operating under certain conditions, as described in the following sections.\nMitigation Option A – Foaming Agents, Soap Strings, Surfactants\nFoaming agents, soap strings and surfactants reduce the density and surface tension of the liquids in\nthe well, thereby reducing the velocity needed for the gas to carry the liquids out of the well. The\nsurfactants are added either as a soap stick or through liquid injection. If the well is deep, injection\nrequires a pump that can be electric, pneumatic, or mechanical.\nOperational Considerations\nFoam produced by surfactants works best in wells where the liquids comprise 50 percent or more\nwater. The surfactants are not effective when mixed with hydrocarbons, so they should only be\nselected when producing significant water. Foaming agents generally work best where the rate of\nliquid accumulation is low.\nSurfactants can be delivered to the well as soap sticks or as a liquid directly injected into the casing-\ntubing annulus. In a shallow well, the surfactant can be delivered by pouring it down the annulus of\nthe well through an open valve. In a deep well, a surfactant injection system will be required (along\nwith regular monitoring). The surfactant injection system includes a surfactant reservoir, a motor\nvalve (usually with a timer, depending on the system design), an injection pump, and a power source\n7 API, ANGA.

Options for pumps include electric,\nmechanical, and pneumatic. Various pump types have different advantages regarding reliability,\nprecision, efficiency, and maintenance frequency.\nIf Partners plan to install a surfactant injection system, implementing this technology requires the\ninstallation of the following equipment:\n A surfactant reservoir.\n A motor valve (usually with a timer, depending on the system design).\n An injection pump (electric, mechanical, or pneumatic).\n A power source for the pump.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nAccording to Natural Gas STAR’s Lessons Learned, the foaming agent saves 178 to 7,394 thousand\ncubic feet (Mcf) per well per year (5 to 209 thousand cubic meters (Mcm) per well per year) compared\nto swabbing and blowing down a well.9\nEconomic Considerations\nThe cost for using a foaming agent depends on whether a pump is necessary. The pump cost can range\nfrom $500 to $9,900, and the surfactants cost $500 per month.10 The economics of foaming agents\ninclude the upfront capital cost of the surfactants and potentially a pump, the volume of gas savings\nif the previous practice was blowing down the well, and the revenue from increased production. Based\non partner Natural Gas STAR companies, the increased production using foaming agents ranged from\n360 to 1,100 Mcf (10 to 31 Mcm) per well per year.11 Many other additional costs should be\nconsidered, including elimination of well swabbing and electricity.\nMitigation Option B – Velocity Tubing/Strings\nThe velocity of the gas being produced is a function of the pressure drop and the cross-sectional area\nof the production tubing. Therefore, one option is to install velocity tubing. Velocity tubing effectively\nreduces the cross-sectional area of the well, thereby increasing the velocity.\nOperational Considerations\nVelocity tubing requires relatively low liquid production and a higher reservoir pressure to create the\nnecessary pressure drop. As a rule of thumb, velocity tubing can be effective with velocities above\n1,000 feet/minute (ft/min) (305 meters/minute, m/min). As the velocity falls below 1,000 ft/min (305\nm/min), such tubing is no longer effective. An Inflow Performance Relationship curve should be used\nto assess the flow of the well. Foaming agents can be used in conjunction with velocity tubing to\nextend the effectiveness of velocity tubing at lower velocities.\nWells that are marginal producers are candidates for velocity tubing. Marginal wells are defined as “a\nproducing well that requires a higher price per Mcf or per barrel of oil to be worth producing, due to\nlow production rates and/or high production costs from its location (e.g., far offshore; in deep waters;\n9 EPA.

This cost\nincludes the workover rig time, downhole tools, tubing connections, and labor. The economics of\nvelocity tubing include the upfront capital cost, the volume of gas savings if the previous practice was\nblowing down the well, and the revenue from increased production. According to partner companies\nin Natural Gas STAR, velocity tubing increases production between 9,125 and 18,250 Mcf/well per\nyear (258 and 517 Mcm/well per year). Other additional costs that should be considered include\nelimination of well swabbing.\nMitigation Option C – Plunger Lift\nA plunger lift system uses the energy of the gas pressure build-up in the casing and reservoir to push\na plunger up the well. The plunger acts like a piston to remove undesired liquids from the well. A\nplunger lift system comprises a lubricator and holding component, a bumper spring at the bottom of\nthe well, and the plunger. This system is used as the velocity decreases, indicated by a change in\npressure of the casing. Because the pressure drops as the liquid level increases, the plunger lift is used\nwhen the pressure in the casing reaches a predetermined level. The plunger lift can be operated\nmanually, with a mechanical timer, pressure controllers or with an automated “smart” cycle timer\nsystem. The gas line is closed off, the plunger drops, the well is shut to allow pressure to build up\nbehind the plunger in the casing, and the well is then opened to the sales line lifting the plunger with\nthe liquids out of the well.\nPlunger systems are not always a mitigation technology, since plunger systems can be vented\nfrequently enough to produce higher net emissions than from less frequent manual unloading. Per\nthe above, plunger lifts can be considered mitigation technologies when they are optimized to achieve\nminimal gas venting.\nOperational Considerations\nA few conditions must be met before a plunger lift system can be justified. First, fluid removal needs\nto be necessary to maintain production. As stated previously, this situation is more common in mature\nwells because of the liquid build-up that occurs over time. Additionally, for the plunger to have the\nrequired force, wells must produce 400 scf (11 scm) of gas per barrel of fluid per 1,000 feet (305\n12 Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (2010).

The shut-in wellhead pressure also needs to be at least 1.5 times the sales line\npressure. Wells that have scale or paraffin build-up also are candidates for plunger lifts.\nImplementing this technology requires the installation of the following equipment:\n Lubricator\n Plunger catcher and bumper\n Plunger\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nExample: A well blowdown is estimated to emit 2,000 scf (57 scm) per hour. With a blowdown\noccurring once every month, the potential reduction is 24 Mscf (0.7 Mscm) per year, assuming 1 hour\nper blowdown. Overall methane emissions reductions would be the eliminated blowdown emissions\nminus the estimated venting from a plunger lift operation.\nEconomic Considerations\nEPA’s Natural Gas STAR technical document for installing plunger lifts on wells13 indicates the cost for\nimplementing a plunger lift is estimated to be $1,900 to $7,800 with a maintenance cost of $1,300 per\nyear. The economics of a plunger lift include the upfront capital cost, the maintenance costs, the\nreduced emissions volume compared to the previous operational practices, and the revenue from\nincreased production. In one example, according to Natural Gas STAR partner company data from 14\nsites in Midland Farm Field, Texas, production increased by 91 Mcf/day (2.6 Mcm/day) 30 days after\nimplementing the plunger lift. Depending on the method in place for removing the liquids before a\nplunger lift, many other additional costs should be considered, including the well treatment costs,\nelectricity savings, and workover costs savings and the salvage value of any previous technology such\nas a beam lift. The plunger lift has no well treatment costs, has reduced electricity costs, and has\nreduced workover costs compared to a beam lift. Based on a Natural Gas STAR Partner’s experience,\ninstalling a plunger lift could have a payback in less than two months and yield excellent gas savings\nas well as increased gas production.\nMitigation Option Ca – Plunger Lift with Cycle Optimization\nMitigation Option Ca1 – Simple Cycle Optimization.\nWhere plunger lifts exist and where they vent frequently, Partners can modify the plunger operation\nby using timers or other controllers that optimize the liquids unloading frequency.\nThis is essentially a subset or rather predecessor to applying “smart technology” outlined below. A\ntimer or controller (e.g. pressure) may be installed on the well and engage the plunger lift (and liquids\nunloading events) such that the frequency of events is minimized, but the well is able to produce.\nPartners may be able to determine the timing in which liquids would build up in the well sufficient to\ncause the well to cease flowing. A timer could be set to control the frequency of the liquids unloading\ncycling based on the estimated time the well would fill with liquids. Another option would be to use a\npressure controller to minimize the frequency of liquids unloading cycles. In this case, the pressure\n13 EPA.

Implementing this\ntechnology requires the installation of:\n Remote terminal unit with programmable logic controllers\n Tubing and casing transmitters\n Gas measuring equipment\n Control valve\n Plunger detector\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nEmission reductions are a function of the flowing pressure and operational characteristics and do not\nlend themselves to generalization. Partners employing this option should determine baseline\nemissions before implementing this option and then evaluate emissions after implementation to\ndetermine emission reductions.\nEconomic Considerations\nThe cost for implementing “smart” technology is incremental above plunger lifts. One EPA Natural Gas\nSTAR partner has estimated the cost for smart technology to be $5,700 to $18,000 per well14. This\ntechnology enables the user to maximize the effectiveness of a plunger lift. The user therefore sees\nadditional increased gas production and therefore additional economic benefit.\nMitigation Option D – Pumps and Compressors\nPumps, gas lift, and wellsite compression may be mitigation measures implemented in some wells to\nabate venting associated with manual, intermittent and plunger lift liquids unloading in which\natmospheric venting occurs.\nDownhole Pumps, reciprocating (rod or beam) and rotating (progressive cavity): A rod (or beam)\npump, either electric or natural gas, can pump the liquids to the surface. These methods can extend\nthe lifetime of the well beyond that possible with the plunger lift, but will have normal operating and\nmaintenance costs.\nGas Lift: Another potential technique to combat the liquids unloading issue in horizontal wells is gas\nlift. Gas lift systems send high-pressure gas into the casing of the well, which increases the pressure\ndifferential between the bottom of the well and the wellhead.

The major requirement for gas lift is\na readily available high-pressure wellsite compressor.\nSequential Lift: In addition, Muskegon Development Company has used a technology called sequential\nlift to combat liquid build-up. This technology uses a series of pumps that follow the horizontal well\nand pump liquids from the well. Muskegon Development Company reports that sequential lift was\nmore effective than gas lift for managing liquids and minimizing emissions from their wells. The\nArtificial Lift R&D Council (ALRDC) collects and reports developments for horizontal gas wells.15\nOperational Considerations\nExample. A rod pump can remove liquids when there is a lower pressure drop than is needed for a\nplunger lift to work. Furthermore, the rod pump can remove the liquids regardless of the gas velocity,\nthereby extending the lifetime of the well beyond other liquid removal techniques.\nImplementing this technology requires the installation of:\n Sucker rod and tubing\n Rod guides, or\n Pump, and\n Pump motor\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nExample. In some cases, rod pumps can save an estimated 770 to 1,600 Mcf/well per year.16\nEconomic Considerations\nExample. The cost for implementing a rod pump is estimated to be $25,900 to $51,800 with a\nmaintenance cost of $1,300 to $19,500 per year, well treatment cost of $13,200, and electricity cost\nof $1,000 to $7,300 per year.17 The economics of a rod pump include the upfront capital cost, the\nmaintenance costs, and the volume of gas savings if the previous practice was blowing down the well,\nthe revenue from increased or extended production (or both), the electricity cost, and the well\ntreatment costs.\nESTIMATING MITIGATED EMISSIONS\nFor the purpose of this Technical Guidance Document, it is suggested that mitigated emissions be\ndetermined using an emissions hierarchy of direct measurement, engineering equations, and\nemissions factors.\nFor wells that employ foaming agents, surfactants, or velocity strings/tubing as a mitigation measure,\nthe estimated mitigated emissions are the estimated emissions of the well prior to the mitigation (e.g.\nfoaming agent) minus the estimated emissions after mitigation.\n15 Artificial Lift R&D Council (ALRDC), Artificial Lift in Horizontal Wells. “Selection of Artificial Lift Systems for Deliquifying Gas\nWells” Prepared by Artificial Lift R&D Council. http://www.alrdc.com/recommendations/horizontalartificiallift/index.htm.\n16 Ibid.\n17 EPA.

It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and\nnatural gas production operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies\nfor quantifying methane emissions from specific sources and describes established mitigation\noptions that Partners should reference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP\nrecognizes that the equipment and processes described in these documents are found in a variety\nof oil and gas operations, including onshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which\nthe emissions are quantified and mitigated may vary across locations and operational environments.\nAs such, operational conditions, as well as logistical, safety and cost considerations, must be\nevaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP assumes that methane emission mitigation actions\nthat require shut-downs of non-redundant equipment/processes (e.g., that would result in a\nstoppage of operations) would be carried out during regularly scheduled maintenance activities,\nunless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy of an early/additional shut-down.\nDescription of Source\nCompletion of new wells and reworking (workover) of existing gas wells in tight formations may\ninvolve hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir to increase well productivity. In such cases, operators\nfracture the reservoir rock with very high pressure water containing a proppant (generally sand) that\nkeeps the fractures “propped open” after water pressure is reduced. Removing the water and excess\nproppant (generally sand) during completion and well clean-up may result in significant releases of\nnatural gas and therefore methane emissions to the atmosphere. After initial drilling, all natural gas\nwells must undergo well completion before commencing production.\nCompleting these new and “workover” hydraulically fractured gas wells involves producing the fluids\nat a high rate to lift the excess sand to the surface and clear the well bore and formation to increase\ngas flow. Typically, the gas/liquid separator installed for normal well flow is not designed for these\nhigh liquid flow rates and three-phase (gas, liquid, and sand) flow. Therefore, a common practice for\nthis initial well completion step has been to produce the well to a pit or tanks where water,\nhydrocarbon liquids, and sand are captured and slugs of gas vented to the atmosphere or flared.\nCompletions can take anywhere from several hours to several weeks, during which time a substantial\namount of gas may be released to the atmosphere or flared. Production levels are tested during the\nwell completion process, and it may be necessary to repeat the fracture process to achieve desired\nproduction levels from a particular well.\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\nPage 1 of 8",

    "text": "Venting/Flaring During Well Completion for Hydraulically Fractured Wells\nIn the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 40 CFR Part 98.62 describes a well completion as the following:\n“Well completions means the process that allows for the flow of petroleum or natural gas from newly drilled\nwells to expel drilling and reservoir fluids and test the reservoir flow characteristics, steps which may vent\nproduced gas to the atmosphere via an open pit or tank. Well completion also involves connecting the well\nbore to the reservoir, which may include treating the formation or installing tubing, packer(s), or lifting\nequipment, steps that do not significantly vent natural gas to the atmosphere. This process may also include\nhigh-rate flowback of injected gas, water, oil, and proppant used to fracture or re-fracture and prop open new\nfractures in existing lower permeability gas reservoirs, steps that may vent large quantities of produced gas to\nthe atmosphere.”\nConventional wells typically do not require production stimulation due to the well-defined permeable and\nporous formations in conventional gas reservoirs. However, industry reports that hydraulic fracturing is\nalso performed in some conventional gas reservoirs as well.3\nCompletions and workovers for hydraulically fractured well may be configured in a variety of ways, as shown\nin Table 8.1.\nTable 8.1: Configurations for Well Venting/Flaring during Well Completions for Hydraulically\nFractured Gas Wells\nConfiguration Mitigated or Unmitigated\nDuring completion of hydraulically fractured gas well, well is\nproduced to a pit or tanks where water, hydrocarbon liquids, and\nUnmitigated\nsand are captured and slugs of gas vented to the atmosphere.\nExhibit A\nDuring completion of hydraulically fractured gas well, reduced\nMitigated (if confirmed to be\nemission (green) completion is implemented, using speciality flow-\nfunctioning with low or no\nback equipment if necessary, and flowback gas is routed to sales\nmethane emissions) A\nor flare as soon as feasible (e.g., gas content of flowback is\nsufficient) rather than vent to the atmosphere. Exhibit B\nA Partner companies are requested to internally confirm proper functioning of mitigation technology,\nand reporting that a source is mitigated implies that this check has been done. “Low” methane\nemissions is defined as being consistent with “expected emissions levels if mitigation option is in place\nand functioning properly (e.g., flare is not extinguished, only non-combustible gas is vented, etc.).”\nPartners should quantify and evaluate for mitigation any of the configurations above that are not identified as\n“mitigated” for methane emissions, per the sections below. It should be noted that, even in the “mitigated”\nsituations described above, Partners should evaluate the system to ensure that it is not malfunctioning in some\nway resulting in higher methane emission levels (e.g., a flare has blown out, venting system is malfunctioning,\nonly non-combustible gas with too high concentration of nitrogen and/or carbon dioxide is vented rather than\nflared or produced to a sales line, etc.).\nQuantification Methodology\nIt is recommended that one or more of the following methodologies be used to quantify volumetric methane\nemissions from venting during each well completions of hydraulically fractured wells.

Where a\nsound basis is in place, measurement can contribute to greater certainty on emissions levels and economic\ncosts and benefits (i.e., value of gas saved). As such, measurement is highly encouraged whenever it is possible\nto establish this basis. These measurements and calculations can give a flow rate for whole gas that is then\nconverted to methane emissions using the methane content of the gas being vented, and then extrapolated for\nthe duration of the completion. An annual volume of methane emissions is calculated by multiplying the\nmeasured methane emissions flow rate by the annual number of completions and workovers for a well. An\nalternative quantification methodology is provided for situations in which direct measurement is not feasible.\nThe CCAC OGMP recommends partner companies to use one of the following methodologies to assure the\nconsistent quantification of emissions and the comparable evaluation of mitigation options. Individual\ncompanies may choose an alternative quantification methodology if judged to be similar or more accurate by\nthe company, in which case the alternative methodology shall be documented and explained in the Annual\nReport.\n Direct Measurement and Calculation Methodology: Partners can quantify methane emissions from venting\nduring well completion for hydraulically fractured wells using direct measurement and engineering\ncalculations using existing quantification methodologies, such as the one shown in 40 CFR Part 98.233 (g)\n(Subpart W of the Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule).5 If the produced gas is directed to a storage tank or a\nthree-phase separator, Partners can measure the flowback rate at the vent stack of either unit using a\nrecording flow meter. Recommended measurement tools include the following:\n Vane Anemometer.\n Hotwire Anemometer.\n Turbine meter.\n Orifice meter.\nFor more details regarding each measurement tools recommended above, including applicability and\nmeasurement methods, please refer to Appendix A.\nSince the flowback rate is not consistent throughout the duration of the flowback, Partners should calculate\nthe total flowback volume from the recorded flowback rates and use the equation below to estimate\nemissions. In the case where the flowback process is not continuous, Partners should add all the recorded\nflowback volumes to determine the overall flowback volume, deducting any amount of CO or N injected\n2 2\ninto the reservoir during the energized fracture job. This calculation methodology is shown in the following\nequation.\n \nE\ns,n\n FV\ns, p\n EnF\ns, p\nWhere:\nE = Annual volumetric total gas emissions in cubic feet at standard conditions from gas well venting\ns,n\nduring completions or workovers following hydraulic fracturing for a well.\nFV = ……\ns,p\n4 Measurements should be conducted with appropriately calibrated instruments and per the manufacturer instructions for conducting\nmeasurements. Measurements should also be conducted under different operating conditions, to the extent that those can affect\nemissions levels. Guidance on instrument use can be found in the Appendix A to the Technical Guidance Documents. Where\ncompanies seek to generate Emission Factors for their operations, direct measurement should be based on a statistically sound\nnumber of measurements and gas analyses to understand the content of methane and other valuable hydrocarbons.\n5 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting – Subpart W – Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems - Section 98.233 Calculating GHG\nEmissions. 40 CFR 98.233(g). http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?SID=9db68a97576bb01eea9073c37d6f0e90&node=40:21.0.1.1.3.23&rgn=div6.\nPage 3 of 8",

To quantify emissions, Partners should multiply the emission factor with the number of\ncompletions of each type. \nMitigation Option - Conduct reduced emission (green) completions, using speciality flowback equipment\nif necessary, and route flowback gas to sales or flare rather than vent.\nReduced emission completions (RECs) are a successful established methane reduction technology, in which\noperators use specialty flowback equipment and route completion flowback gas to a sales line or flare rather\nthan venting to the atmosphere. For RECs, operators install portable equipment during the final stage of a well\ncompletion that is particularly designed and sized for the initial production (essentially the high flowback) rate\nof water, sand, and gas. The objective of the technology is to capture and deliver gas to the sales line or flare\nrather than venting it.\nProduced gas often needs additional treatment to remove any solids and water for the gas to be considered\npipeline quality. The treatment process includes passing the produced gas through sand traps, plug catchers,\ndehydrators, and three-phase separators to remove finer solids, large solids such as drill cuttings, water, and\ncondensate, respectively. Partners can conduct the dehydration step using a permanent glycol dehydration unit\nor a portable glycol or desiccant dehydrator. The condensate (i.e., liquid hydrocarbons) recovered during the\nthree-phase separation may be sold for additional revenue.\nThe specialty portable equipment used during RECs is required solely during the final stage of a well\ncompletion and can be transferred to another well site upon completion. Additional temporary piping may\nneed to be installed for connections. A gas producer might find it economical for a basin with high drilling\nactivity to build its own REC skid. On the other hand, Partners that have used third-party providers to perform\nRECs find it most beneficial to combine the scheduling of completions with the annual drilling program. Note\nthat some Partners have reported installing permanent equipment that is oversized to handle the initial\nflowback and that then remains onsite to handle the normal operations from the well.\nOperational Considerations\nThe mitigation option for this emission source, namely RECs, is appropriate only for gas wells that undergo well\ncompletions using hydraulic fracturing. Additionally, for capturing and delivering gas to the sales line, as\nopposed to flaring, the system should already have a sales line in place.\nWhen installing the portable equipment, the piping configuration is critical, as the high-velocity water and sand\ncan erode holes in steel pipe elbows, creating “washouts” with water, sand, hydrocarbon liquids, and gas in\nunmitigated flows to the pad. Along with piping, Partners might consider installing additional equipment for\ntreating produced gas to remove impurities for the gas to be considered pipeline quality.\nMethane Emission Reduction Estimate\nThe amount of methane emissions that can be reduced using RECs varies widely based on reservoir\ncharacteristics and other parameters, including length of completion, number of fractured zones, pressure,\ngas composition, and fracturing technology/technique. “Energized” fractures, in which inert gases such as\nnitrogen or carbon dioxide are injected with the initial water, have a flowback composition that cannot initially\nbe directed to a gas sales line. Some reservoirs are so low pressure that the flowback would be too slow and\ninefficient to be directed through the REC equipment. In these cases or malfunction of the REC equipment\n(plugging), some of the flowback gas should be directed to a flare or combustion device if feasible, which\nPage 4 of 8",

The low end of the cost range ($800/day) represents completions and workovers where key\npieces of equipment to perform the REC (e.g., a dehydrator or three-phase separator) are already onsite and\nare of suitable design and capacity to use during flowback. The high end of the cost range ($7,500/day)\nrepresents situations where key pieces of equipment to perform the REC are temporarily brought on site and\nthen relocated after the completion or workover. The cost of the equipment depends on the number of days\nof flowback, the initial production rate, and the availability of treatment equipment such as a permanent glycol\ndehydration unit.\nThe total cost per well was assessed based on an average of daily cost and the number of days per completion.\nThe average incremental cost is $4,150 per day and the average completion lasts seven days.8 Based on these\naverages, the overall incremental cost is $29,000 per well for a REC versus an unmitigated completion.9\nPartners should include an additional $700 to account for transporting and placing equipment, giving a total\nincremental cost of $29,700 per well.10 RECs are considered one-time events per well. Therefore, annual costs\ncan be conservatively assumed to be the same as capital costs.\nThe amount of gas that can be recovered from RECs varies widely based on several different variables (i.e.,\nreservoir pressure, production rate, amount of fluids lifted, and total completion time). The savings associated\nwith the additional gas captured to the sales line can be estimated based on a natural gas value of $3/MMBtu.\nIt can be assumed that all gas captured will be included as sales gas. As a result, assuming that 90 percent of\nthe gas that was previously vented to the atmosphere is captured and sold, this equals a total recovery of 8,260\nMcf (234 thousand scm)11 of natural gas per hydraulically fractured completion or workover. The estimated\nvalue of the recovered natural gas for an example natural gas well with hydraulic fracturing is approximately\n$24,780. In addition, RECs typically recover an estimated average of 34 barrels of condensate per completion\nor workover.12 The recovered condensate is valued at about $2,400 (assuming a condensate value of $70 per\nbarrel13), which brings total savings to $27,180 per well. When considering these savings, the net cost for this\nREC (completion or workover) example is now $2,520 per well. For these average economics of a process with\na wide range of gas and condensate recoveries, approximately half the applications will have positive\neconomics.\n6 U.S. EPA. “Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production, Transmission, and\nDistribution.” Background Technical Support Document for Proposed Standards. https://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-\nand-natural-gas-industry.\n7 Ibid.\n8 Ibid\n9 Ibid.\n10 Ibid.\n11 Ibid.\n12 Ibid.\n13 Ibid.\nPage 5 of 8",

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document Number 9\nCasinghead Gas Venting\nTECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENT NUMBER 9:\nCASINGHEAD GAS VENTING\nIntroduction\nThis document provides technical guidance to Partners of the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership\n(OGMP). It is one in a series describing a core source of methane emissions from oil and natural gas\nproduction operations. The guidance documents introduce suggested methodologies for quantifying\nmethane emissions from specific sources and describe established mitigation options that Partners should\nreference when determining if the source is “mitigated.”1 The OGMP recognizes that the equipment and\nprocesses described in these documents are found in a variety of oil and gas operations, including\nonshore, offshore, and remote operations, and the way in which the emissions are quantified and\nmitigated may vary across locations and operational environments. As such, operational conditions, as\nwell as logistical, safety, and cost considerations, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The OGMP\nassumes that methane emission mitigation actions that require shut-downs of non-redundant\nequipment/processes (e.g., that would stop operations) would be carried out during regularly scheduled\nmaintenance activities, unless the Partner deems the corrective action to be worthy of an early/additional\nshut-down.\nDescription of Source\nCasinghead gas is gas that collects in the annular space between the casing and tubing in an oil well.\nUsually beneficial, casinghead gas forces the produced oil up the tubing. In a mature oil well equipped\nwith a beam pump or electric submersible pump, however, this gas can begin restricting oil flow,\ndecreasing a well’s production by vapor locking the pump. Combined with the backpressure of an oil well’s\nsurface equipment, pressure from casinghead gas can severely restrict production. Partners must remove\ncasinghead gas pressure build-up in a well’s annular space to maintain production. One of the methods\nto do this is to vent the casinghead gas to the atmosphere at or near the wellhead.\nCasinghead gas venting can occur, and may be mitigated, in a variety of ways. Partners are encouraged to\nidentify and deploy appropriate controls for each oil well. Some options include those listed in the\nfollowing Table 9.1.\nFor the purposes of the OGMP, Partners will quantify and evaluate for mitigation any configuration\npresented in Table 9.1 that is identified as “unmitigated” for methane emissions, as described in the\nsections below. Even for “mitigated” configurations, Partners should evaluate the system to ensure that\nit is functioning properly and minimizing methane emission levels. Possible equipment failures resulting\nfrom improperly functioning systems include a well compressor malfunction, a VRU malfunction, or an\nextinguished flare. Moreover, Partners should evaluate gases routed to a flare (flow rate, composition) to\nestimate methane emissions resulting from the flare combustion efficiency.\n1 For reporting purposes as described in the CCAC Oil and Gas Methane Partnership Framework, Section 3.\nPage 1 of 10",

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document Number 9\nCasinghead Gas Venting\nentire year. The annual volume of methane emissions is calculated by multiplying the measured\nmethane flow rate by the operating hours of the well.\nDetermining the point where the casinghead gas is being vented is essential so that accurate\nmeasurements can be taken. Typically, an oil wellhead has a designated gas vent line for casinghead\ngas. Each wellhead setup is unique, however, and a wellhead could have multiple lines for venting\ncasinghead gas. Partners should confirm the locations of all lines before measuring casinghead gas.\nRecommended measurement tools include the following:\n Turbine meter.\n Hotwire anemometer.\n Vane anemometer.\nViewing all gas lines with an infrared leak-imaging camera (designed to visually identify hydrocarbon\nemissions) during venting of casinghead gas will also help to identify potential fugitive leak emissions.\nFor more details regarding each measurement and detection tool, including applicability and\nmeasurement methods, please refer to Appendix A.\n Engineering Calculation:\nAn engineering calculation relies on a representative sample of well production taken with no\ncasinghead gas venting: i.e. capture all gas and oil entering the well casing. This may be more costly\nand less accurate than direct measurement, given the sampling method can affect the production rate\nand composition. From this sample a gas/oil ratio (GOR) may be determined. For mature wells,\nPartners should use the estimated well’s producing GOR (scf/bbl or scm/bbl) multiplied by the\nproduction rate of oil per year (bbl/year) and the methane content of the gas to estimate annual\nmethane emissions. Oil wells with casinghead gas venting are typically mature and thus pump nearly\n“dead” crude from the reservoir. This crude contains a very small amount of dissolved gas, most of\nwhich escapes into the casing before the crude is pumped up the tubing to the surface. Periodic\nventing the casinghead gas often is necessary to avoid vapor locking the down-hole pump.\nMitigation Option A – Install compressors/VRUs to capture casinghead gas.\nPartners have found that using a small wellhead reciprocating compressor can facilitate recovery of\npreviously vented casinghead gas to sell or to use on site as fuel. Drawing down the casing pressure can\nalso increase oil production. Traditionally, companies have used a skid-mounted compressor to recover\nvented gas. Ideally, the compressor would maintain the casinghead gas pressure as close as possible to\nzero pounds per square inch gauge (psig) without pulling a vacuum. Maintaining a constant zero pressure\nhelps stabilize the oil line pressure and reduces fluctuations in flow. When feasible, multiple wells can be\nconnected to a single compressor to optimize cost.\nPartners can use either a wellhead reciprocating compressor or a VRU to recover casinghead gas.\nDepending on the characteristics and the destination of the recovered gas, one of these options might\nmake more sense than the other. A typical VRU is designed to maintain a suction pressure near-\natmospheric pressure. For wet-screw, rotary-vane, or scroll-type, single-stage compressors, the discharge\nis limited to about 100 psig (7 kg/cm2) by the compression ratio. If the gas destination is at a pressure\ngreater than 100 psig (7 kg/cm2), Partner will need to use two-stage compression with intercooling, which\nmight require a reciprocating compressor.\nPage 3 of 10",

    "text": "CCAC OGMP – Technical Guidance Document Number 9\nCasinghead Gas Venting\nOperational Considerations\nFor capturing wet casinghead gas at near-atmospheric pressure, a skid-mounted VRU type wellhead\ncompressor is best. Viable compressor types include rotary-vane, rotary-screw, and scroll. For high\ncompression ratios, such as a strong vacuum on the casing or high discharge pressure or both, Partners\ncan use two- or three-stage compression. Rotary-vane compressors generally have proven to be the most\ncost-effective when handling small volumes of casinghead gas. Casinghead gas typically is wet because it\nflashes off from the underground oil reservoir that has a specific gravity of around 0.85 (16 gallons of\nliquid per Mscf gas)5 (2.1 liters liquid per scm gas). Both rotary-vane and scroll compressors can handle\nwet gas effectively, but reciprocating compressors generally cannot, so the first stage in multi-stage\ncompression should be one that handles wet gas effectively. All compressors, and all compression stages\nin multistage compressors, must have a suction scrubber to handle liquid slugs.\nSkid-mounted compressors can be powered by an electric motor or a combustion engine, typically ranging\nfrom 10 to 200 horsepower (HP). The availability of a power source, either electricity or fuel gas, primarily\ndetermines which option is more viable. If electricity is not available, a beam-mounted compressor is an\noption. Beam-mounted compressors use the mechanical energy from a well’s rod pumping unit to pull\ngas from the casing and discharge it into a flow line. These compressors can be single- or double-acting\n(able to compress on both strokes). Not all wells respond favorably to reduced casinghead pressure, and\nthere is no quick means to predict the response. Companies might want to test some wells in a reservoir\nbefore they purchase or lease compression equipment to determine how the wells will respond. If the\nresponse is favorable, testing also can confirm whether the increased productivity is temporary or\nsustained. Every well and reservoir have different characteristics. Specific gravity, gas volume, and\npressure of the discharge line for the casinghead gas are some critical factors that Partners should\nconsider when purchasing or designing a wellhead compressor or VRU. Even wells from the same\nformation can respond differently to casinghead gas capture, which also points to the need for testing. A\ngeneral guideline is if oil production increases remain constant 30 to 45 days after testing, venting\ncasinghead gas is appropriate.\nExperience has shown that casinghead gas capture typically is more successful for wells with water or\ncarbon dioxide floods. Wells with enhanced oil recovery (where produced gas can be reinjected into the\nreservoir) also are good candidates for casinghead gas capture. One vendor estimated that approximately\n65 percent of mature oil wells are appropriate for casinghead gas capture.6 To avoid a large pressure drop,\nthe compressor or VRU should not be placed too far from the wellhead.\nIn some situations, a compressor or VRU can be linked to multiple wells. The connected wells should be\nlocated near each other and have similar surface pressures. This will help ensure the compressor or VRU\npulls on the wells equally, allowing their surface pressures to be closer to zero psig (zero kg/cm2) gauge\npressure. Also, the closer the wells are to each other and to the compressor or VRU, the smaller the\npressure drop will be in the suction flow lines. Partners should take into consideration for this option,\nhowever, that depending on a single unit could be problematic when the compressor or VRU is down for\nrepair or maintenance, and gas from several wells requires venting.\n5 Natural Gas STAR Partner Update.

The\nfollowing scenario example is taken from the Natural Gas STAR technical document Install Compressors\nto Capture Casinghead Gas.9 Capital costs for connecting casinghead gas to a new compressor would be\napproximately $12,500 for a 30-HP electric rotary compressor capable of delivering up to 200 Mscf (5.7\nMscm) of gas per day10 into a 100-psig (7 kg/cm2) sales line.11,12 Installation costs are assumed to be 1.5\ntimes the equipment cost, bringing the total implementation cost to nearly $32,000.13 Additional\noperating costs would include the electricity to power the compressor, which (assuming the compressor\noperates for half the year and electricity costs $0.075 per kilowatt-hour (kWh)) would bring the annual\noperating costs to $7,350.14\n7 Typically electric-driven rotary vane, rotary screw, or scroll compressor.

Partners also\nshould install pressure regulators if low-pressure casinghead gas is joined with sources having higher\npressure (e.g., dehydrator flash tank separator) at the VRU suction point.

For annual gas savings of 7,800\nMscf (221 Mcm) at $3 per Mscf, the value of the recovered gas would be $23,400. The value of this\nrecovered gas would help pay back the additional electricity and piping costs for this project and the value\nof the increased oil production is likely to be even greater.\nFor more information, see the Natural Gas STAR technical document Connect Casing to Vapor Recovery\nUnit (https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-\n06/documents/connectcasingtovaporrecoveryunit.pdf).\nMitigation Option C – Route casinghead gas to flare.\nTwo possible scenarios for this project are: route to an existing flare or route to a newly installed flare. If\nan existing flare is within reasonable proximity, however, this scenario is preferred, as routing casinghead\ngas to an existing flare, provided operational and safety conditions allow, rather than installing a new one\nis easier and lower cost for Partners. The more casinghead vents that can be routed to a single flare will\nhelp improve project viability, in terms of cost versus methane reductions achieved, in addition to other\nbenefits. Partners should route casinghead gas to a recovery outlet whenever possible; sending the gas\nto a flare should be a last resort. Additionally, in some cases a lit flare might have higher greenhouse gas\nemissions than an unlit flare, (i.e. taking into account the safety flaring: purge gas and pilot gas burned to\nensure the safe operation of the flare), which Partners should take into account when considering\nimplementing this project.\nOperational Considerations\nA wellhead can have a flare stack for emergency releases, blowdowns, etc. For this project, if a flare is\ninstalled, all that would then be required is additional piping to route the casinghead gas vent to the flare.\nIf no flare exists, however, Partners will have to install one.
